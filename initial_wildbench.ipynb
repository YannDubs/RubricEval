       "The narrative voice of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young limited yet fluid third-person narrative style, which is closely aligned to the consciousness of Stephen Dedalus. We never get to see inside other characters’ heads; instead, we see them the way Stephen does.. The subjectivity of first-person narration (in the form of a diary at the end) is combined with the objectivity of third-person narration, resulting in a narrative voice that is capable of conveying Stephen’s experiences and thoughts with an immediacy and an intimacy that, until then, had been rarely achieved in the bildungsroman form. Indeed, the book focuses so closely on Stephen, and takes us so deeply into his mind, that at times it resembles a first-person narrative. By doing so, the inner life of Stephen seeks to delineate in such a way that it does not merely serve the unfolding of the story but becomes the story. The narrator presents Stephen’s consciousness and activities in various ways; an important aspect about his narration is that he persistently adapts his style to Stephen’s idiom and mood\n"

       " I am under the supervision of a coach.\n",

       "- Whey protein - 25-30g within 30 minutes after your workout to help build and repair muscle tissue. Choose a high quality whey isolate or concentrate.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Creatine monohydrate - 5g daily. Creatine can help boost strength and muscle mass when combined with proper strength training. \n",
       "\n",
       "- BCAAs (branched chain amino acids) - 10g during workouts. BCAAs can help decrease muscle breakdown during intense exercise.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Multivitamin - Choose one formulated for athletes to help cover any potential nutrient gaps in your diet.\n",
       "\n",
       "In terms of diet, make sure you are consuming enough calories and protein to support muscle growth. Aim for 1-1.5g of protein per pound of body weight per day. Time your carbohydrate intake around your workouts for energy. Continue to eat healthy, whole food sources of carbs and protein.\n",
       "\n",
       "For your training, focus on progressive overload by gradually increasing weight, sets, and reps on your lifts over time to continually challenge your muscles. Emphasize big, compound lifts like squats, deadlifts, bench press, overhead press, rows, and pull ups. Apply good form to prevent injury.\n",
       "\n",
       "Make sure you are sleeping 7-9 hours per night and taking rest days for adequate recovery. Manage your stress levels as well. Proper rest is crucial.\n",

As 'f' increases, the total cost also increases. \n",

This suggests that as the system becomes more complex (higher 'f'), the queuing delays also increase.\n",

Similar to queuing delays, packet drop probability tends to increase with higher values of 'f' and with higher cloud costs.
