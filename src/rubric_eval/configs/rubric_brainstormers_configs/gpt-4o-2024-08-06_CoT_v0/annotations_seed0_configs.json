A grade of 0 will applied to assignments that use material that are neither (a) or (b). \n(4)\tThe assignment is to be written in size 12, Times New Roman font. \n(5)\tA title page and a bibliography are to be included with the assignment. \n(6)\tPages are to be numbered.\n(7)\tA late penalty of 10% per business day up will be applied. \n(8)\tAssignments will no longer be accepted and will be granted a grade of 0 after 5 business days.\n(9)\tStudents will be expected to submit an electronic version of their assignments via Turnitin in the Dropbox on Slate by the deadline to make sure the assignment has not been plagiarized.  \n(10)\tStudents need to cite all information that is not theirs including the course material and the sources listed in Part D. \n(11)\tStudents are strongly discouraged from using direct quotes. Overreliance on direct quotes will lead to points deductions.\n(12)\tThis assignment is to be completed individually; academic sanctions will be applied to students who submit similar work.\nPART B: Assignment Description\n\nThe goal of the assignment is to have students write a public official regarding a problem that is affecting the world today. The public official nevertheless has to be a real one, but students are not obligated to send them the letter. Importantly, students will have to identify which public official they are writing.\nTo write the letter, students are required to use the external sources listed in Part D. They can nonetheless write about any problem within the themes listed in that section. For example, they can write about the problem of hospital wait times within the broader Health Care theme. Or, then again, they can write about Ukraine\u2019s request for jets within the broader War in the Ukraine theme.\nA model and example of how to structure such a letter will be provided in Part E of this document.\nIn terms of getting ideas as to who to write, students might consider bearing in mind the following. For municipal politics such as public transportation and policing; students should consider writing their city councillor or mayor. For matters relevant to provincial politics such as education, health care, and social services; students should consider writing the Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) or the Premier of Ontario. For matters relevant to federal politics such as foreign policy and national economic policy; students should consider writing their Member of Parliament (MP) or the Prime Minister. See Part F of this document for tools for finding their elected officials. Should students want to write an official from another country, they are free to do so.

Cafonian Sea Khanate is located on an archipelago almost entirely covered by taiga, with numerous natural harbors, which predisposes its inhabitants for extensive ship-building. Previously populated by disparate peoples with common origin, eventually they were assimilated by Nalacan ethnic group, united against the foreign colonizers, who tried to claim overlordship over the Cafonian archipelago. De jure it is governed by tradition, with power concentrated in hands of relatively numerous Lumber-Dukes, whose possession of large forested areas translates into possession of large fleets, used for fishing and raiding. The Lumber-Dukes, despite acknowledged possibility of them being at open conflict with each other, swear fealty to the Khan. However, current de facto system of the Sea Khanate is anything but tradition. The Lumber-Dukes still retain some authority, but most of it is controlled by vast, sophisticated, convoluted and byzantine bureaucracy, which is, however, able to function rather efficiently. All military and administrative posts are assigned on rotational basis, switching positions according to complicated procedure, relying on dedicated data-gathering institutions. No person in any position is likely to concentrate too much power and control, both due to rotation and the very distributed nature of authority. While current Khan Semmer is supposed to be the supreme ruler, he seems to make no public appearances. Highest authority, in reality, lies instead in the Council of Khan\u2019s Concubines, who, despite being exclusively female, do not actually perform any of the activities associated with term \u201cconcubine\u201d.

For example, if your answer to a question is 34.5 ms, just write down 34.5 in the answer sheet.\n\n\n1.

Had the (partial) HTTP request in question 1 been the following:\nGET \/818413344.html HTTP\/1.1\nConnection: keep-alive\nAccept-Encoding: gzip\nCache-control: no-store\n\n\nwhat is the minimum time would it take the client, from the time the user clicked to access the URL corresponding to the HTML file, to get the file? As before, assume that this HTML file was never accessed by the client prior to this request. You need to know that the server is able to compress selected content, if requested to do so, and it understands gzip compression. Our HTML file, 818413344.html, would compress to 89 kB when compressed with gzip.\n\n\nOur HTML file, 818413344.html, is now modified, and the modifications include references to 9 PNG images. The size of the modified HTML file is 920 kB, and it would compress to 76 kB when compressed with gzip. The file sizes of the images, given in MB, are as follows: 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 3. The images are named image 0 through to image 8 for convenience, and the image file sizes here are given in that order. The following questions refer to this collection of images and the modified HTML file. Where applicable, requests could be sent back to back without having to wait for the responses.\n\n\n4.

The (partial) HTTP request for the HTML file is shown below.\nGET \/818413344.html HTTP\/1.1\nConnection: close\nAccept-Encoding: identity\nCache-control: no-store\n\n\nYou should assume similar requests to be sent by the client for the images sequentially. The client needs to process the HTML file to find out the URLs of each image, and this processing can start only after the client receives the entire file. For simplicity, assume that this processing time is negligible. How long would it take the client, from the time the user clicked to access the URL corresponding to the HTML file, to get the file and the images it refers to? Assume that none of files (HTML as well the images) have previously been accessed.\n\n\n5.

    "instruction":"ACME energy has diversified and are looking at Wind as an alternate power source. There is an ambitious\nmulti-billion dollar investment plan to put an offshore wind farm with turbines generating energy to help offset\nthe energy demand.\nTo support this business initiative, the Group CIO and CISO are working with regional CIOs and CISOs in the\nrespective countries to identify the future IT and Security strategy to support this initiative. This is a multi-year\ninvestment program, and the decision has been taken to use the public cloud to build the future IT\nenvironment for this initiative. This is also part of a wider cloud migration plan for ACME Energy.\nThe result is a new IT strategy and a corresponding Cybersecurity strategy with several security programs that\nneed to be implemented over a three year period. ACME uses the NIST cybersecurity framework, CIS 18 for\noperational controls and the CSA CCM 4.0 for cloud security controls.\nACME has decided to partner with ZKC Consulting to deliver the cybersecurity strategy and work with regional\nCybersecurity teams to implement the changes. The company has taken a cloud first approach to implement\nthe two new IT strategic programs and three strategic security programs listed below.\n\uf0b7 Design and implementation of new wind farm using cloud technology and remote software updates.\n\uf0b7 Creation of a new data lake that will be used to collect data from the wind turbines and other OT\ndevices, which will be used for several purposes including system monitoring and advanced data\nanalytics capabilities.\nThe strategic security programs are as follows:\n\uf0b7 Provision of secure data connectivity from the wind turbines to the Cloud (the could provider has not\nyet been confirmed).\n\uf0b7 Creation of a new OT Security Operations centre that will monitor the security of the OT devices used\nin the windfarm.\n\uf0b7 Creation of a new Threat Intelligence program to protect the new wind farm infrastructure against\ncyber threats.\nYour Role\nIn your role as an external security consultant, you are required to provide a report advising on the\nimplementation of one of the strategic security programmes: Creation of a new OT Security Operations\ncentre that will monitor the security of the OT devices used in the windfarm.\nThe CIO of ACME has been working with the CISO team to identify the capabilities required to build a Security\nOperations Center (SOC) that will monitor the security of the OT devices. The agreement is to build a SOAR\nplatform that will provide the orchestration, automation and response. This is in addition to the vulnerability\nmanagement and penetration testing requirements. Both teams have agreed that all products need to be\ncloud native and should include the use of a SIEM. The CIO wants to use Azure Sentinel as the SIEM but the\nCISO want to use Google Chronicle. This SIEM will also be used to monitor the security of the data lake. The\nCISO wants to use Qualys as the vulnerability management tool as it is currently being used in ACME.\nYou are expected to provide the following high level outputs for the first phase of the project:\n\uf0b7 Outline the requirements for SOAR in the context of ACME\u2019s operations.\n\uf0b7 Propose a specific SOAR solution based on your requirements.\n\uf0b7 Explain the security controls that need to be implemented for the proposed SOAR solution.\n\uf0b7 Evaluate the Azure Sentinel and Google Chronicle SIEM solutions and provide your recommendation.\nPlease explain the criteria you will be using for your analysis (you do not need to consider criteria\nwhich are not directly impacting the security operations, e.g. costs).\n\uf0b7 Explain the operational procedures the SOC team needs to create to deal with security threats.\n\uf0b7 Please explain how you will integrate different data sources into the SIEM to create a single pane of\nglass view that will provide security analysts the relevant information.\n\uf0b7 Investigate if the Qualys vulnerability management tool is the best tool for ACME and if you feel this is\nnot the right tool, please provide a gap analysis and recommend the tool that should be used.\n\uf0b7 Explain the pentesting approach and define the scope of the pentesting program.\n",

Five years ago he brought\nEmily Redbank (age 49) into the partnership. They are both owners and principals and hold their own\nAustralian financial services (AFS) licence. You are a senior financial adviser employed for the past\nthree years by FutureLife, with an offer for equity in the business within the next few years. With the\nbusiness having experienced exceptional growth over the past 12 months, FutureLife has decided they\nneed an additional adviser. Rather than hire outside the firm, they have opted to transition their young\nsupport staff member, Josie, into an adviser role.\nShaun\u2019s clients are predominantly self-funded retirees, with a small number who require specialised\naged care financial advice. His clients have accumulated their wealth through successful small businesses.\nShaun prefers to look after his existing clients, with any new clients referred to yourself or Emily.\nEmily\u2019s clients (age 35 to 55) are successful wealthy professionals from a mix of professional backgrounds.\nGiven their wealth, Emily has recommended self-managed superannuation funds to a number of these\nclients.\nJosie has worked in the practice in a number of support roles over the last four years while she was\ncompleting her university degree. Josie graduated 12 months ago with an approved Bachelor of Commerce\n(Financial Planning) degree. As part of her career planning, you have agreed to supervise Josie through\nher professional year, and she is currently in the third quarter of her professional year.\nYou have 10 years experience as a financial adviser and are fully qualified to provide advice on a wide range\nof strategies and products. Half of your clients followed you to FutureLife, from your previous financial\nadviser role. When Shaun or Emily is on leave, you also help out by providing advice to their clients. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------- Scenario 3 \u2014 FutureLife clients: Kevin and Anika Leste\nEmily has not been well lately and has just been diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. Her doctors have\nrecommended she take at least six months off from work to concentrate on her treatment plan, which they\nare in the process of finalising. As Emily will be away from the office for some time, she asks you to provide\nadvice for her existing clients.\nYour first meeting is with Emily\u2019s clients, Kevin and Anika Leste. You will be meeting them for the first time\nand Emily has told you they are important clients because they often recommend family, friends and their\nown clients (from their business) to the practice.\nKevin and Anika operate a successful bookkeeping business where they manage the accounts for many\nself-employed clients. There has been a longstanding referral relationship between Emily and the Lestes,\nwhich sees them share many clients. There remains frequent cross-referral of clients between Emily and\nthe Lestes; however, this arrangement has been altered due to the introduction of the Financial Planners\nand Advisers Code of Ethics 2019. Where in the past, Emily simply paid them a referral fee, she now adjusts\nher advice fees (up or down) to Kevin and Anika, in lieu of referral payments.\nThe Leste\u2019s file shows that a Statement of Advice was issued three years ago. The client notes state that\nEmily recommended the Lestes establish an SMSF, and this has now been in place for nearly three years.\nThe file notes also state they have rolled over superannuation from their previous superannuation funds\nwith AustralianSuper and Aware Super. Both funds were previously invested in the \u2018balanced\u2019 options.\nAs bookkeepers, the Lestes undertake a lot of the SMSF administration work themselves. As you read\nthrough their file, it appears they have little knowledge of investing. The only assets currently in the SMSF\nare a $1.4 million term deposit with the CBA and the SMSF administration account with about $60,000.\nYou review their goals and objectives listed in their file and note that their main goals are to build wealth\nfor their retirement and help their adult children.\nAfter introducing yourself to the Lestes, you explain that as you are not fully aware of their financial\nsituation, and as part of the review process, it would be worthwhile revisiting their current situation,\ngoals and objectives. Part-way through the meeting, Kevin takes a phone call and states he will need to\nleave immediately to take care of some urgent business, and Anika can update him later on what was\ndiscussed. However, as he leaves, he says that he just wants you to invest the money in the way you think\nis appropriate for them as \u2018Emily does this all the time\u2019. He adds, \u2018we know how the process works,\nso we don\u2019t really need to go through all the paperwork\u2019. --------------------------- IN a tone other than AI\/ChatGPT please answer the following questions using 2000 words and  at the end give an -in-depth and extensive references list in harvard referencing style guide ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (a) Explain how Emily\u2019s conduct would be assessed under the value of Diligence and Standard 5 of the\nFinancial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics 2019. (10 marks)\n(b) Explain three (3) issues or potential breaches of the Financial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics\n2019 that may arise from Emily\u2019s actions of adjusting advice fees as a result of cross-referrals with\nKevin and Anika. (15 marks)\n(c) Discuss whether Emily\u2019s previous advice to Kevin and Anika meets the best interests obligations\nunder Standard 2 of the Financial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics 2019.

    "instruction":"ACME energy has diversified and are looking at Wind as an alternate power source. There is an ambitious\nmulti-billion dollar investment plan to put an offshore wind farm with turbines generating energy to help offset\nthe energy demand.\nTo support this business initiative, the Group CIO and CISO are working with regional CIOs and CISOs in the\nrespective countries to identify the future IT and Security strategy to support this initiative. This is a multi-year\ninvestment program, and the decision has been taken to use the public cloud to build the future IT\nenvironment for this initiative. This is also part of a wider cloud migration plan for ACME Energy.\nThe result is a new IT strategy and a corresponding Cybersecurity strategy with several security programs that\nneed to be implemented over a three year period. ACME uses the NIST cybersecurity framework, CIS 18 for\noperational controls and the CSA CCM 4.0 for cloud security controls.\nACME has decided to partner with ZKC Consulting to deliver the cybersecurity strategy and work with regional\nCybersecurity teams to implement the changes. The company has taken a cloud first approach to implement\nthe two new IT strategic programs and three strategic security programs listed below.\n\uf0b7 Design and implementation of new wind farm using cloud technology and remote software updates.\n\uf0b7 Creation of a new data lake that will be used to collect data from the wind turbines and other OT\ndevices, which will be used for several purposes including system monitoring and advanced data\nanalytics capabilities.\nThe strategic security programs are as follows:\n\uf0b7 Provision of secure data connectivity from the wind turbines to the Cloud (the could provider has not\nyet been confirmed).\n\uf0b7 Creation of a new OT Security Operations centre that will monitor the security of the OT devices used\nin the windfarm.\n\uf0b7 Creation of a new Threat Intelligence program to protect the new wind farm infrastructure against\ncyber threats.\nYour Role\nIn your role as an external security consultant, you are required to provide a report advising on the\nimplementation of one of the strategic security programmes: Creation of a new OT Security Operations\ncentre that will monitor the security of the OT devices used in the windfarm.\nThe CIO of ACME has been working with the CISO team to identify the capabilities required to build a Security\nOperations Center (SOC) that will monitor the security of the OT devices. The agreement is to build a SOAR\nplatform that will provide the orchestration, automation and response. This is in addition to the vulnerability\nmanagement and penetration testing requirements. Both teams have agreed that all products need to be\ncloud native and should include the use of a SIEM. The CIO wants to use Azure Sentinel as the SIEM but the\nCISO want to use Google Chronicle. This SIEM will also be used to monitor the security of the data lake. The\nCISO wants to use Qualys as the vulnerability management tool as it is currently being used in ACME.\nYou are expected to provide the following high level outputs for the first phase of the project:\n\uf0b7 Outline the requirements for SOAR in the context of ACME\u2019s operations.\n\uf0b7 Propose a specific SOAR solution based on your requirements.\n\uf0b7 Explain the security controls that need to be implemented for the proposed SOAR solution.\n\uf0b7 Evaluate the Azure Sentinel and Google Chronicle SIEM solutions and provide your recommendation.\nPlease explain the criteria you will be using for your analysis (you do not need to consider criteria\nwhich are not directly impacting the security operations, e.g. costs).\n\uf0b7 Explain the operational procedures the SOC team needs to create to deal with security threats.\n\uf0b7 Please explain how you will integrate different data sources into the SIEM to create a single pane of\nglass view that will provide security analysts the relevant information.\n\uf0b7 Investigate if the Qualys vulnerability management tool is the best tool for ACME and if you feel this is\nnot the right tool, please provide a gap analysis and recommend the tool that should be used.\n\uf0b7 Explain the pentesting approach and define the scope of the pentesting program.\n",
