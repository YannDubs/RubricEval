    "instruction":"ACME energy has diversified and are looking at Wind as an alternate power source. There is an ambitious\nmulti-billion dollar investment plan to put an offshore wind farm with turbines generating energy to help offset\nthe energy demand.\nTo support this business initiative, the Group CIO and CISO are working with regional CIOs and CISOs in the\nrespective countries to identify the future IT and Security strategy to support this initiative. This is a multi-year\ninvestment program, and the decision has been taken to use the public cloud to build the future IT\nenvironment for this initiative. This is also part of a wider cloud migration plan for ACME Energy.\nThe result is a new IT strategy and a corresponding Cybersecurity strategy with several security programs that\nneed to be implemented over a three year period. ACME uses the NIST cybersecurity framework, CIS 18 for\noperational controls and the CSA CCM 4.0 for cloud security controls.\nACME has decided to partner with ZKC Consulting to deliver the cybersecurity strategy and work with regional\nCybersecurity teams to implement the changes. The company has taken a cloud first approach to implement\nthe two new IT strategic programs and three strategic security programs listed below.\n\uf0b7 Design and implementation of new wind farm using cloud technology and remote software updates.\n\uf0b7 Creation of a new data lake that will be used to collect data from the wind turbines and other OT\ndevices, which will be used for several purposes including system monitoring and advanced data\nanalytics capabilities.\nThe strategic security programs are as follows:\n\uf0b7 Provision of secure data connectivity from the wind turbines to the Cloud (the could provider has not\nyet been confirmed).\n\uf0b7 Creation of a new OT Security Operations centre that will monitor the security of the OT devices used\nin the windfarm.\n\uf0b7 Creation of a new Threat Intelligence program to protect the new wind farm infrastructure against\ncyber threats.\nYour Role\nIn your role as an external security consultant, you are required to provide a report advising on the\nimplementation of one of the strategic security programmes: Creation of a new OT Security Operations\ncentre that will monitor the security of the OT devices used in the windfarm.\nThe CIO of ACME has been working with the CISO team to identify the capabilities required to build a Security\nOperations Center (SOC) that will monitor the security of the OT devices. The agreement is to build a SOAR\nplatform that will provide the orchestration, automation and response. This is in addition to the vulnerability\nmanagement and penetration testing requirements. Both teams have agreed that all products need to be\ncloud native and should include the use of a SIEM. The CIO wants to use Azure Sentinel as the SIEM but the\nCISO want to use Google Chronicle. This SIEM will also be used to monitor the security of the data lake. The\nCISO wants to use Qualys as the vulnerability management tool as it is currently being used in ACME.\nYou are expected to provide the following high level outputs for the first phase of the project:\n\uf0b7 Outline the requirements for SOAR in the context of ACME\u2019s operations.\n\uf0b7 Propose a specific SOAR solution based on your requirements.\n\uf0b7 Explain the security controls that need to be implemented for the proposed SOAR solution.\n\uf0b7 Evaluate the Azure Sentinel and Google Chronicle SIEM solutions and provide your recommendation.\nPlease explain the criteria you will be using for your analysis (you do not need to consider criteria\nwhich are not directly impacting the security operations, e.g. costs).\n\uf0b7 Explain the operational procedures the SOC team needs to create to deal with security threats.\n\uf0b7 Please explain how you will integrate different data sources into the SIEM to create a single pane of\nglass view that will provide security analysts the relevant information.\n\uf0b7 Investigate if the Qualys vulnerability management tool is the best tool for ACME and if you feel this is\nnot the right tool, please provide a gap analysis and recommend the tool that should be used.\n\uf0b7 Explain the pentesting approach and define the scope of the pentesting program.\n",

Britt uses leg braces to alleviate pain and spasms in her legs, hand and arm braces to support and spare her relatively unaffected muscles and joints, and special neck brace to keep her head from falling.
