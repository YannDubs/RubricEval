We are conducting a holistic evaluation of powerful large language models (LLMs). To achieve this, you need to write for each assignment a checklist of criteria to consider when evaluating the output.

Generate a JSON output containing:
- checklist (list[str]): A list of 5-10 concrete and detailed questions tailored to the assignment to consider when evaluating the output.

Ensure that the checklist is comprehensive, interpretable, and easy to verify. The JSON output will be used by make_evaluation_report(json_output) to generate the final evaluation of the LLM.

# Assignment
{instruction}

Now generate the final evaluation using `make_evaluation_report(json_output)``.
