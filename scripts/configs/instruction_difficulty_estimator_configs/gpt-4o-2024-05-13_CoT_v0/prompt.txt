We are performing a holistic evaluation of powerful large language models (LLMs). To do so we need to come up with a diverse set of prompt to grade the LLM on. The responses to those prompts are expected to be extensive and complex.
We have generated two prompts and we would like to know which one is more complex, extensive and harder to respond to.
- Prompt A: {promptA}
- Prompt B: {promptB}

Please generate your aswer as a single letter A or B. Your answer should be a list of json objects that is then given to `save_comparison_two_prompts(preference)`. Each containing the fields:
- `preference`: A string containing the letter A or B, indicating the preferred prompt.
