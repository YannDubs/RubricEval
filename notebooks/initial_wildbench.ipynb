We never get to see inside other characters’ heads; instead, we see them the way Stephen does.. The subjectivity of first-person narration (in the form of a diary at the end) is combined with the objectivity of third-person narration, resulting in a narrative voice that is capable of conveying Stephen’s experiences and thoughts with an immediacy and an intimacy that, until then, had been rarely achieved in the bildungsroman form. Indeed, the book focuses so closely on Stephen, and takes us so deeply into his mind, that at times it resembles a first-person narrative. By doing so, the inner life of Stephen seeks to delineate in such a way that it does not merely serve the unfolding of the story but becomes the story. The narrator presents Stephen’s consciousness and activities in various ways; an important aspect about his narration is that he persistently adapts his style to Stephen’s idiom and mood\n"

More edge processing is better for cost while more cloud processing is better for reliability."

       "**Output**:  To investigate the trade-off between the overall cost, queuing delays, and packet drop probability based on the simulation results provided, we can analyze the data points for different combinations of node and cloud servers with varying values of queuing delays, packet loss rates, and total costs.\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Overall Cost Analysis:**\n",
       "   - The total cost is directly related to the combination of edge and cloud costs as well as the scaling factor 'f'.\n",
       "   - As the cloud cost increases, the total cost also increases, indicating that utilizing cloud servers can be more expensive.\n",
       "   - The scaling factor 'f' also affects the total cost, with higher values of 'f' leading to increased total costs.\n",
       "   - It's essential to consider the total cost in the context of the benefits gained in terms of performance and reliability.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Queuing Delay Analysis:**\n",
       "   - Queuing delays are influenced by both the cloud and edge costs as well as the scaling factor 'f'.\n",
       "   - Higher queuing delays are observed with higher values of 'f', which indicates that as more processing is offloaded to the cloud, the queuing delays might increase.\n",
       "   - The choice between edge and cloud servers can impact queuing delays, with cloud servers potentially introducing higher delays due to communication overhead.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Packet Drop Probability Analysis:**\n",
       "   - Packet drop probability is a critical metric for assessing the reliability of the system.\n",
       "   - Higher values of 'f' can lead to increased packet drop probabilities, especially when utilizing more cloud servers.\n",
       "   - The choice of server configuration can also impact packet drop rates, with cloud servers potentially introducing higher packet drop probabilities due to network congestion or processing delays.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Trade-off Analysis:**\n",
       "   - There is a trade-off between overall cost, queuing delays, and packet drop probability.\n",
       "   - It is crucial to strike a balance between minimizing costs, reducing queuing delays, and maintaining acceptable packet drop probabilities.\n",
       "   - Decision-makers need to consider these trade-offs based on the specific requirements of the system, such as performance targets, budget constraints, and reliability needs.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, the analysis of the simulation results highlights the interconnected nature of overall cost, queuing delays, and packet drop probability in system performance. Understanding these trade-offs can help in making informed decisions regarding server configurations and resource allocation to optimize system performance while managing costs and ensuring reliability."
