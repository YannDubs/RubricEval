       "The narrative voice of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young limited yet fluid third-person narrative style, which is closely aligned to the consciousness of Stephen Dedalus. We never get to see inside other characters’ heads; instead, we see them the way Stephen does.. The subjectivity of first-person narration (in the form of a diary at the end) is combined with the objectivity of third-person narration, resulting in a narrative voice that is capable of conveying Stephen’s experiences and thoughts with an immediacy and an intimacy that, until then, had been rarely achieved in the bildungsroman form. Indeed, the book focuses so closely on Stephen, and takes us so deeply into his mind, that at times it resembles a first-person narrative. By doing so, the inner life of Stephen seeks to delineate in such a way that it does not merely serve the unfolding of the story but becomes the story. The narrator presents Stephen’s consciousness and activities in various ways; an important aspect about his narration is that he persistently adapts his style to Stephen’s idiom and mood\n"

       "Queuing Delay:\n",

       "\n",
       "Packet Loss Rate: \n",
       "- Packet loss rate increases significantly as the split ratio (f) increases, indicating that more edge processing leads to higher packet loss. This makes sense since edge resources are less reliable.\n",

Queuing delay does not change much across different parameters. The optimal configuration depends on the performance vs cost requirements. More edge processing is better for cost while more cloud processing is better for reliability."

       "<br>**Feedback**:  <u>Clarity and Structure</u>: The analysis is structured and presents its findings<br>  in a logical order, making it relatively easy to follow. However, it could benefit<br>  from clearer highlighting of key points and more detailed explanations to improve<br>  understanding.<br><u>Data Interpretation</u>: The analysis correctly identifies the relationship between<br>  cloud cost and overall cost, and notes the impact of the split ratio on packet loss<br>  rate. However, it oversimplifies the impact of cloud cost and split ratio on queuing<br>  delays, suggesting they remain stable without providing a detailed examination of<br>  the data.<br><u>Depth of Analysis</u>: The analysis mentions the key variables and their impacts<br>  but does not delve deeply into how different configurations affect the metrics or<br>  consider the limitations of the simulation. It lacks a comprehensive examination<br>  of the data and its potential real-world applications.<br><u>General Quality</u>: The analysis provides a basic overview of the simulation results<br>  and their implications but lacks conciseness and depth. It is somewhat clear but<br>  could be more insightful and focused to better aid understanding, especially for<br>  those not familiar with the field.<br><u>Trade-off Analysis</u>: The analysis effectively highlights the trade-off between<br>  cost and packet loss rate with varying split ratios, but it lacks depth in exploring<br>  the implications of these trade-offs for different configurations. It does not provide<br>  specific recommendations or detailed analysis supported by data.<br>"
