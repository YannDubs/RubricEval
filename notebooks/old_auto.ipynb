       "\n",
       "At first, some saw it as a miracle, imagining a utopian world of mutual understanding and empathy. Teachers hoped it would revolutionize education, as knowledge could be transferred telepathically. Lovers thought it would bring new depths of intimacy. \n",
       "\n",
       "But it quickly became apparent that hearing every stray thought of those around you was overwhelming. People learned to guard their minds, but this took intense focus and isolation. Even then, innermost feelings and impulses could sometimes burst to the surface uncontrollably.\n",
       "\n",
       "Trust eroded. Friends and lovers felt betrayed by glimpses into private thoughts they were never meant to see. Political negotiations stalled, as no one could strategize or even lie without revealing their motives. Within families, generations clashed as aged mentalities encountered youthful ideas directly.\n",
       "\n",
       "A new culture emerged, one of extreme discretion and restraint. Social interactions became more scripted and reserved. New laws were passed to protect privacy and limit telepathic intrusions. Schools were redesigned to prevent distraction, with telepathic-dampening architecture. \n",
       "\n",
       "Some with telepathy retreated from society, living as hermits. Others banded together to form exclusive communities. Everyday life had irrevocably changed.\n",
       "\n",
       "A generation came of age who had never known anything else. Telepathy was the new status quo. They learned to adapt, using it as just another sense. Support groups helped people adjust to hearing thoughts while maintaining intimacy and trust. Slowly, society stabilized.\n",
       "\n",
       "But deep questions remained unanswered. Would telepathy continue to spread? What new leaps in cognition could come next? And could humanity ever regain the innocence of solitary thought? The path ahead was unclear."
