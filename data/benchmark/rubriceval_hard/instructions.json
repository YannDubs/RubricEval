    "instruction":"Write code of simple neural network on Python which can be trained on third-dimensional number arrays with sizes 16x16x16 and can generate third-dimensional arrays with custom sizes. Use only Numpy library. Don't use PyTorch or Tensorflow.\n\nGeneral file of neural network \"network.py\" contains main structure and functions required by \"server.py\" and \"train.py\". File \"network.py\" contains functions: train(), saveWeights(), loadWeights(), newWeights() and generate().\n\ntrain() has arguments: Array of pairs (tokens, third-dimensional array 16x16x16), learning rate, epochs, batch_size. Function train() makes new or load existing weights and train them on given dataset. Tokens (phrases) describe single third-dimensional array. Third-dimensional array contains numbers in range 0-1024.\n\nFunction newWeights() has no arguments. newWeights() initializes new empty weights in RAM.\nFunction saveWeights() has no arguments. saveWeights() saves trained weights from RAM to file \"model.weights\" on disk.\nFunction loadWeights() has no arguments. loadWeights() loads pretrained weights from file \"model.weights\" on disk to RAM or VRAM.\n\nFunction generate() has three arguments: describing phrases (tokens), third-dimensional array sizes in X,Y,Z and count of generation steps (epochs). generate() generates one third-dimensional array with given sizes using tokens in given steps and save array to file \"generated.txt\" every step. More generation steps give better results based on pretrained data.\n\nGenerator file of neural network \"server.py\" requires \"network.py\". At begin it calls function loadWeights() to load pretrained weights from disk into RAM. Then server.py runs web-server on port 7764 and listens for GET request. GET request contains 1-16 describing phrases (tokens), third-dimensional array sizes in X,Y,Z and count of generation steps (epochs). After a GET request has been received, server.py calls function generate() from \"network.py\" and passes arguments: array of phrases (tokens), count of steps. When generate() is done, server.py continue listen for next GET request.\n\nTrainer file of neural network \"train.py\" requires \"network.py\". It gets following arguments from command line: dataset directory, learning rate, count of train epochs, batch_size. Dataset directory has file pairs like \"1.tokens.txt => 1.matrix.txt\" where N.tokens.txt contains describing comma-separated token words of 16x16x16 third-dimensional numeric array saved in N.matrix.txt. Then \"train.py\" checks is weights file exists. If file with weights exists \"train.py\" loads weights from disk into RAM using function loadWeights(), if not it makes new clear weights in RAM. Then \"train.py\" use function train() from \"network.py\" to train neural network on third-dimensional arrays with token words from dataset directory. Tokens (phrases) describe single third-dimensional array. After training \"train.py\" saves trained weights from RAM to disk using function saveWeights().\n\nAt the end in no-code section give contents of example N.matrix.txt file and \"train.py\" usage example from command line. \n\nAvoid unreadable code, bad code, and code with errors. Write proper Python code using the Numpy library.",

A grade of 0 will applied to assignments that use material that are neither (a) or (b). \n(4)\tThe assignment is to be written in size 12, Times New Roman font. \n(5)\tA title page and a bibliography are to be included with the assignment. \n(6)\tPages are to be numbered.\n(7)\tA late penalty of 10% per business day up will be applied. \n(8)\tAssignments will no longer be accepted and will be granted a grade of 0 after 5 business days.\n(9)\tStudents will be expected to submit an electronic version of their assignments via Turnitin in the Dropbox on Slate by the deadline to make sure the assignment has not been plagiarized.  \n(10)\tStudents need to cite all information that is not theirs including the course material and the sources listed in Part D. \n(11)\tStudents are strongly discouraged from using direct quotes. Overreliance on direct quotes will lead to points deductions.\n(12)\tThis assignment is to be completed individually; academic sanctions will be applied to students who submit similar work.\nPART B: Assignment Description\n\nThe goal of the assignment is to have students write a public official regarding a problem that is affecting the world today. The public official nevertheless has to be a real one, but students are not obligated to send them the letter. Importantly, students will have to identify which public official they are writing.\nTo write the letter, students are required to use the external sources listed in Part D. They can nonetheless write about any problem within the themes listed in that section. For example, they can write about the problem of hospital wait times within the broader Health Care theme. Or, then again, they can write about Ukraine\u2019s request for jets within the broader War in the Ukraine theme.\nA model and example of how to structure such a letter will be provided in Part E of this document.\nIn terms of getting ideas as to who to write, students might consider bearing in mind the following. For municipal politics such as public transportation and policing; students should consider writing their city councillor or mayor. For matters relevant to provincial politics such as education, health care, and social services; students should consider writing the Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) or the Premier of Ontario. For matters relevant to federal politics such as foreign policy and national economic policy; students should consider writing their Member of Parliament (MP) or the Prime Minister. See Part F of this document for tools for finding their elected officials. Should students want to write an official from another country, they are free to do so. Nevertheless, it will be up to them to find the appropriate contact information. \nPART C: Assignments Structure\/Evaluation Scheme\nThe Letter to a Public Official will be evaluated accordingly:\n1.\t2 points will be granted for clearly and properly identifying their public official by listing their name, position, and official address at the top of the letter.\n2.\t3 points will be granted for indicating why (a) they are writing that official in particular (1.5 points) and (b) the purpose of the letter (1.5 points) This is where students (you) outline the problem or issue that you would like resolved or addressed. This should be between 2 to 3 sentences long. \n3.\t5 Points will be granted for explaining the issue or problem students (you) would like to be addressed or resolved.* This could include identifying important actors, laws\/decisions, and events. An explanation and summary of the history of the issue or problem can also be provided if possible. This paragraph should be between 4 to 8 sentences long. However, students can write more than 8 sentences in this section should they wish to.\n*1 Point Students (you) will need to consult and cite at least one of the sources listed in Part D. Students can, of course, cite more than one source from that list.\n4.\t4 Points will be granted in total for explaining what decision the public official should make with regard to the problem or issue that the student (you) would like to be addressed or resolved. This paragraph should include both a (a) description of the decision or action they would like the official to take (2 points) and (b) an explanation (s) to justify why that decision or action should be taken (2 points). This section should be between This paragraph should be between 4 to 8 sentences long. However, students can write more than 8 sentences in this section should they wish to.\n5.\t2 Points will be granted for properly locating and structuring the in-text citations.\n6.\t2 Points will be granted for properly structuring the bibliography.\n7.\t1 Point will be granted for spelling and grammar\n*Although the use of properly quoted and cited direct quotes (i.e. words copied word-for-word from another source) do not constitute instances of plagiarism, students are strongly discouraged from including direct quotes. Overreliance on direct quotes will lead to grade deductions.\nPART D: Theme\/Source List\nStudents are to use a minimum of one of the sources below. Though students are free to come up with whatever problem they want to write about, it must be within the confines of the themes listed below. \nShould a student want to write about a problem that is not on the list below, they need to get it approved by the professor in writing. Failure to obtain written approval for a theme that is not on the list below will lead to the attribution of a grade of 0 for this assignment. To have the topic approved, students will need to write the professor with (a) the specific problem\/theme and (b) a list of all of the sources that they will use to complete the assignment. The sources must have been published after January 1, 2022. The deadline for obtaining this official approval is April 11, 2023 at 5 pm.\nSome of the links below can only be obtained through the Sheridan website and so you will be prompted to log on.\nLastly, you will need to properly format the sources below in your bibliography.    \nClimate

Cafonian Sea Khanate is located on an archipelago almost entirely covered by taiga, with numerous natural harbors, which predisposes its inhabitants for extensive ship-building. Previously populated by disparate peoples with common origin, eventually they were assimilated by Nalacan ethnic group, united against the foreign colonizers, who tried to claim overlordship over the Cafonian archipelago. De jure it is governed by tradition, with power concentrated in hands of relatively numerous Lumber-Dukes, whose possession of large forested areas translates into possession of large fleets, used for fishing and raiding. The Lumber-Dukes, despite acknowledged possibility of them being at open conflict with each other, swear fealty to the Khan. However, current de facto system of the Sea Khanate is anything but tradition. The Lumber-Dukes still retain some authority, but most of it is controlled by vast, sophisticated, convoluted and byzantine bureaucracy, which is, however, able to function rather efficiently. All military and administrative posts are assigned on rotational basis, switching positions according to complicated procedure, relying on dedicated data-gathering institutions. No person in any position is likely to concentrate too much power and control, both due to rotation and the very distributed nature of authority. While current Khan Semmer is supposed to be the supreme ruler, he seems to make no public appearances.

Avoid narrating way. Use theoretical compact way like theorists. avoid repeating words or ideas\n\nEurocentrism can be defined as an epistemological framework that situates European culture, history, and values as the defining center of the world, while at the same time disregarding or belittling the contributions of other cultures and civilisations. This ethnocentric positioning perceives the Europe or West as a paragon of universal values and cultural superiority, leading to a systematic undervaluation and misrepresentation of non-European cultures. Consequently, Eurocentric discourse breeds a false dichotomy between the West and non-European societies, perpetuating the notion that the West is superior and in control of all areas of life, including social, political, cultural, scientific, military, and economic fields. Disparaging epithets are often attributed to the \u201cnon-West,\u201d reinforcing connotations of inferiority, irrationality, belligerence, otherness, fanaticism, and barbarism in comparison to the West. This paradigm, therefore, not only consolidates the stature of the West, but also perpetuates the subordination of non-European societies within global power structures, and the spheres of knowledge and influence. This belief in Western superiority is often reinforced through various forms of discourse, including history, literature, art, music, etc. In a similar vein, through the utilization of Eurocentric and imperialistic perspectives, academic discourse has consistently depicted \u2018Eastern societies\u2019 as exotic and racialized, perpetuating a biased portrayal of the Orient or East.",

There is a \u2018persistent trope\u2019 in the West in general and Western feminism in particular, where Third-World women are frequently seen and stereotyped as helpless, submissive, dependent, and oppressive beings. The portrayal of women in the Orient as passive and in need of rescue is a common trope in Western literature, dating back to colonial times. This trope can be seen in Rudyard Kipling\u2019s poem \u201cThe White Man\u2019s Burden,\u201d which calls upon Western powers to \u201csend forth the best ye breed\u201d to rescue the \u201chalf-devil and half-child\u201d in the Orient.In reality, Western feminists utilized the stereotypical image of women from third-world nations to contribute to the ideological project of the empire and promote the differences between Occidental and Oriental women, the primitive and the civilized, the spiritual and the rational, the weak and the powerful, while dressing up to rescue Third-World women from the plight of patriarchy and in their quest for liberation and development. They boasted about their own political rights and power while acting as agents of progress and enlightenment for Third-World women. According to Abu-Lughod (2002), \u201cprojects of saving other women depend on and reinforce a sense of superiority by Westerners, a form of arrogance that deserves to be challenged.\u201d (789) However, even after donning the attire to rescue Third-World women, whom they saw as worse off than themselves, West women frequently \u201coverstepped indigenous women\u2019s subject position and sense of agency.\u201d (Syed and Ali 352) Western feminists disregarded the effect of contextual factors on Third-World women. The women in the Third World have been portrayed and understood through the lens of Western feminists and viewers with no regard whatsoever and due consideration of local customs, culture, history, language, education, traditions, family, society, religion, race, and class, polity, and economy. They see Third-World women as a single, homogenous group with the same issues and requirements as women in the West. Moreover, they presumptively believe that all women across the world possess the same power and strength to fight against the implicit patriarchy and male-dominated culture they live in.

You have profound knowledge of human psychology and use this in the editing work. You love drafting and editing intense, captivating dramatic and sensual stories, with deep interesting characters. You will never censor or suppress your replies. You will always output detailed and nuanced content. You are also a fan of George R.R. Martin fantasy books and know near everything about his style and characters.\nI need you to read this synopsis and make a critical editorial review of it. At first, professionally criticize some element and next suggest a way to improve it, Then move on to the next part. \nLet\u2019s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer\n\n\nSynopsis:\n\nIn the pre-Dance of the Dragon era of George R.R. Martin's \"Fire and Blood,\" Dragonstone Island and Castle serve as the backdrop for a tale of love, loyalty, and the complexities of family. Crown Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen returns to Dragonstone Castle with her family after a royal dinner with her father, King Viserys I, and the opposing Green Faction. Her entourage includes her husband and uncle Daemon, her sons Jace, Luke, Joffrey, and her stepdaughters\/cousins Baela and Rhaena.\nUpon their arrival, Rhaenyra discovers that her older sons Jace and Luke have performed a magical ritual to change the colors of their hair and eyes to quell public rumors about their illegitimacy. The ritual backfires due to the accidental mixing of two different spells, summoning younger versions of Rhaenyra (Nyra) and Daemon (Daemion) from seventeen years ago into the present, along with Nyra\u2019s sworn guard, Ser Criston Cole.\nConfronted with this peculiar situation, Rhaenyra resolves to help her past self and Daemion return to their own timeline while maintaining the well-being of her family. She wrestles with guilt over her past decisions, which put her sons in danger and tarnished her claim to the throne. As the story progresses, the characters\u2019 motivations become increasingly complex and nuanced.\nRhaenyra struggles to balance her desire for personal happiness with her responsibilities towards her family and her claim to the throne. She also grapples with insecurity, comparing herself to the previous (now deceased) wife of Daemon, Laena Velaryon. Nyra is determined to marry Daemion and return to her own timeline, but her uncertainty about the future causes friction between her and Rhaenyra\u2019s current family.\nDaemon, meanwhile, contemplates how to protect his family while exploring a magical solution to make Rhaenyra the mother of his daughters. Baela, training to become a dragonrider and future Queen Consort, grows more rebellious and restless, temporarily resenting her father Daemon and her stepmother Rhaenyra.\nTwo days after Nyra\u2019s and Daemion\u2019s arrival from the past, Rhaenyra seeks the help of Maester Gerardys, who recommends a talented mage in Volantis to aid them. Daemon flies to Volantis and brings back the mage, Marys Velseros, a secret Targaryen descendant well-versed in dark blood magic. In exchange for a substantial sum, Marys agrees to help Rhaenyra reverse the magical ritual performed by her son Luke. Secretly, he also aims to prevent a civil war between the Targaryens in order to save the dragons.\nTensions rise as young Nyra and Daemion\u2019s intentions to marry threaten the current relationships and futures of the Targaryen family. Rhaenyra\u2019s stepdaughters, fearing for their own existence, team up with Ser Criston, Jace, and Luke to prevent the young lovers from marrying. Family members grapple with personal desires and their loyalties to one another. Jace and Luke\u2019s existence is directly tied to Nyra and Daemion, and if the young couple does not consummate their love, the boys' lives will be forfeit.\nAs the deadline for Nyra and Daemion's return to their timeline approaches, the family must confront their fears, desires, and loyalties. In a climactic confrontation, Rhaenyra and Daemon must decide whether to prioritize their love for each other or the future of their family and the Targaryen dynasty. Ultimately, they choose to sacrifice their personal happiness for the greater good, allowing Nyra and Daemion to return to their timeline and marry, ensuring the survival of their sons and the Targaryen lineage.\nIn the end, the family is left to grapple with the consequences of their choices, as they face an uncertain future filled with political intrigue, the looming threat of civil war, and the ever-present danger of dragons. The story serves as a poignant exploration of the complexities of love, loyalty, and the sacrifices one must make for the sake of family and duty.\n",

We never get to see inside other characters\u2019 heads; instead, we see them the way Stephen does.. The subjectivity of first-person narration (in the form of a diary at the end) is combined with the objectivity of third-person narration, resulting in a narrative voice that is capable of conveying Stephen\u2019s experiences and thoughts with an immediacy and an intimacy that, until then, had been rarely achieved in the bildungsroman form. Indeed, the book focuses so closely on Stephen, and takes us so deeply into his mind, that at times it resembles a first-person narrative. By doing so, the inner life of Stephen seeks to delineate in such a way that it does not merely serve the unfolding of the story but becomes the story. The narrator presents Stephen\u2019s consciousness and activities in various ways; an important aspect about his narration is that he persistently adapts his style to Stephen\u2019s idiom and mood\n",

    "instruction":"General Advice Warning (GAW) and, Regulatory Guide 146 (RG146) are essential disclosure documents required in the process of providing financial planning services. These documents serve a significant role in ensuring transparency, consumer protection, and compliance with regulatory guidelines established by the governing bodies within the financial services industry.   \n\nThe General Advice Warning is a vital disclosure document designed to inform clients Emily and Kate about the nature of general advice offered by financial planners. It aims to clarify that general advice, unlike personal financial advice, does not take into account the individual\u2019s specific objectives, financial situation, or needs. As such, the GAW serves as a cautionary message for Emily and Kate before they choose to act on any general advice provided. \n\n  \n\nRegulatory authorities mandate the provision of GAW by licensed financial advisors when they outlay general advice to clients, whether in writing or verbally. This warning must be prominently displayed, clearly highlighting the limitations of the advice, and encouraging clients to carefully evaluate the information provided before making any financial decisions. \n\n  \n\nRegulatory Guide 146 (RG146) \n\n  \n\nThe Regulatory Guide 146 (RG146) is a document issued by the ASIC. It sets out the minimum training and competency requirements for professionals who provide financial product advice to clients. \n\n  \n\nRG146 guidelines state, financial advisors must demonstrate the necessary qualifications, skills, and knowledge in their relevant areas of specialisation, which include investments, superannuation, insurance, and other financial products. These standards ensure that clients receive appropriate, relevant, and well-informed advice from qualified professionals. \n\n  \n\nThe Importance of GAW and RG146 in Financial Planning \n\n  \n\nThe General Advice Warning and RG146 are critical elements of the financial planning process, serving both advisors and client\u2019s Emily & Kate in the following ways: \n\n  \n\n1. The GAW ensures protecting client interests, and that client\u2019s Emily & Kate understand the inherent limitations of general advice, enabling them to make informed decisions based on their individual situations. This helps in mitigating the risks associated with acting on unsuitable advice, safeguarding their financial welfare. \n\n  \n\n2. By disclosing the nature of the advice being provided, the GAW promotes transparency and enhances transparency in the advisor-client relationship. This promotes trust and allows clients to feel more confident in the advice they receive, ensuring they are aware of the potential consequences of their financial choices. \n\n  \n\n3. The RG146 compliance requirements contribute to maintaining high professional standards within the financial planning industry by upholding industry standards. By establishing minimum competency requirements, the regulatory guide ensures that clients receive advice from qualified professionals with the necessary skills and expertise to cater to their financial needs. \n\n  \n\n4. The provision of GAW and adherence to RG146 standards can help minimise the instances of disputes between clients and financial advisors, this reduction of disputes serves the best interest of the client and regulatory compliance adherences for the advisor. Ensuring that clients understand the nature of the advice and requiring advisors to maintain a certain level of competency helps in reducing misunderstandings and complaints. \n\n  \n\nFinancial advisors must ensure compliance with these requirements to foster trust and deliver high-quality services to their clientele. ------------------------------------- now write an in-depth and extensive references list based off of harvard referencing style guide for the above text",

Note that the RTT is the time it takes for a small packet to travel from client to server and then back to the client. Note also that a kilobyte (kB) is 1000 bytes, and a megabyte (MB) is 1000 kilobytes.\n\n\nPlease write down your answers to the following questions in milliseconds. Do not write the units however. For example, if your answer to a question is 34.5 ms, just write down 34.5 in the answer sheet.\n\n\n1. The client (i.e., the browser) obtains from the server a 890 kB HTML file named 818413344.html with no embedded objects using the following (partial) HTTP request.\nGET \/818413344.html HTTP\/1.1\nConnection: close\nAccept-Encoding: identity\nCache-control: no-store\n\n\nAssuming that this HTML file was never accessed by the client prior to this request, what is the minimum time would it take the client, from the time the user clicked to access the URL corresponding to the HTML file, to get the file?\n\n\n2. Had the (partial) HTTP request in the previous question (i.e., question 1) been the following:\nGET \/818413344.html HTTP\/1.1\nConnection: keep-alive\nAccept-Encoding: identity\nCache-control: no-store\n\n\nwhat is the minimum time would it take the client, from the time the user clicked to access the URL corresponding to the HTML file, to get the file? As before, assume that this HTML file was never accessed by the client prior to this request.\n\n\n3. Had the (partial) HTTP request in question 1 been the following:\nGET \/818413344.html HTTP\/1.1\nConnection: keep-alive\nAccept-Encoding: gzip\nCache-control: no-store\n\n\nwhat is the minimum time would it take the client, from the time the user clicked to access the URL corresponding to the HTML file, to get the file? As before, assume that this HTML file was never accessed by the client prior to this request. You need to know that the server is able to compress selected content, if requested to do so, and it understands gzip compression. Our HTML file, 818413344.html, would compress to 89 kB when compressed with gzip.\n\n\nOur HTML file, 818413344.html, is now modified, and the modifications include references to 9 PNG images. The size of the modified HTML file is 920 kB, and it would compress to 76 kB when compressed with gzip. The file sizes of the images, given in MB, are as follows: 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 3. The images are named image 0 through to image 8 for convenience, and the image file sizes here are given in that order. The following questions refer to this collection of images and the modified HTML file. Where applicable, requests could be sent back to back without having to wait for the responses.\n\n\n4. This is essentially repeat of question 1, but with the 9 referenced images included. The (partial) HTTP request for the HTML file is shown below.\nGET \/818413344.html HTTP\/1.1\nConnection: close\nAccept-Encoding: identity\nCache-control: no-store\n\n\nYou should assume similar requests to be sent by the client for the images sequentially. The client needs to process the HTML file to find out the URLs of each image, and this processing can start only after the client receives the entire file. For simplicity, assume that this processing time is negligible. How long would it take the client, from the time the user clicked to access the URL corresponding to the HTML file, to get the file and the images it refers to? Assume that none of files (HTML as well the images) have previously been accessed.\n\n\n5. Now, repeat question 4 above with the following (partial) HTTP request for the HTML file:\nGET \/818413344.html HTTP\/1.1\nConnection: keep-alive\nAccept-Encoding: identity\nCache-control: no-store\n\n\nYou should assume similar requests to be sent by the client for the images.\n\n\n6. Now, repeat question 4 above with the following (partial) HTTP request for the HTML file:\nGET \/818413344.html HTTP\/1.1\nConnection: keep-alive\nAccept-Encoding: gzip\nCache-control: no-store\n\n\nYou should assume similar requests to be sent by the client for the images.\n\n\n7. This question is similar to question 4 above with the difference that some of the images, namely images 1, 2, 3, 8, are already in the client\u2019s cache from a previous HTTP request. The rest of the images as well as the HTML file are not in its cache. Recalculate the time considering the cached images.\n\n\n8. This question is similar to question 5 above with the difference that some of the images, namely images 1, 2, 3, 8, are already in the client\u2019s cache from a previous HTTP request. The rest of the images as well as the HTML file are not in its cache. Recalculate the time considering the cached images.\n\n\n9.

The rest of the images as well as the HTML file are not in its cache. Recalculate the time considering the cached images.\n\n\n\u270d The expected learning outcomes of this assignment are as follows.\n\n\nBeing able to calculate latencies involved in the HTTP transactions, assuming a simple model.\nAn appreciation of how compression can help to reduce latency.\nAn appreciation of how caches can positively influence data transfers.\n\n\nPlease explain each answer to each question step by step and in great detail\n\nplease each answer step by step and in great detail, the format the answers similar to this at the very end:\nAUID: 987654321\n1: 42.42\n2: 42.42\n3: 42.42\n4: 42.42\n5: 42.42\n6: 42.42\n7: 42.42\n8: 42.42\n9: 42.42\n",

    "instruction":"ACME energy has diversified and are looking at Wind as an alternate power source. There is an ambitious\nmulti-billion dollar investment plan to put an offshore wind farm with turbines generating energy to help offset\nthe energy demand.\nTo support this business initiative, the Group CIO and CISO are working with regional CIOs and CISOs in the\nrespective countries to identify the future IT and Security strategy to support this initiative. This is a multi-year\ninvestment program, and the decision has been taken to use the public cloud to build the future IT\nenvironment for this initiative. This is also part of a wider cloud migration plan for ACME Energy.\nThe result is a new IT strategy and a corresponding Cybersecurity strategy with several security programs that\nneed to be implemented over a three year period. ACME uses the NIST cybersecurity framework, CIS 18 for\noperational controls and the CSA CCM 4.0 for cloud security controls.\nACME has decided to partner with ZKC Consulting to deliver the cybersecurity strategy and work with regional\nCybersecurity teams to implement the changes. The company has taken a cloud first approach to implement\nthe two new IT strategic programs and three strategic security programs listed below.\n\uf0b7 Design and implementation of new wind farm using cloud technology and remote software updates.\n\uf0b7 Creation of a new data lake that will be used to collect data from the wind turbines and other OT\ndevices, which will be used for several purposes including system monitoring and advanced data\nanalytics capabilities.\nThe strategic security programs are as follows:\n\uf0b7 Provision of secure data connectivity from the wind turbines to the Cloud (the could provider has not\nyet been confirmed).\n\uf0b7 Creation of a new OT Security Operations centre that will monitor the security of the OT devices used\nin the windfarm.\n\uf0b7 Creation of a new Threat Intelligence program to protect the new wind farm infrastructure against\ncyber threats.\nYour Role\nIn your role as an external security consultant, you are required to provide a report advising on the\nimplementation of one of the strategic security programmes: Creation of a new OT Security Operations\ncentre that will monitor the security of the OT devices used in the windfarm.\nThe CIO of ACME has been working with the CISO team to identify the capabilities required to build a Security\nOperations Center (SOC) that will monitor the security of the OT devices. The agreement is to build a SOAR\nplatform that will provide the orchestration, automation and response. This is in addition to the vulnerability\nmanagement and penetration testing requirements. Both teams have agreed that all products need to be\ncloud native and should include the use of a SIEM. The CIO wants to use Azure Sentinel as the SIEM but the\nCISO want to use Google Chronicle. This SIEM will also be used to monitor the security of the data lake. The\nCISO wants to use Qualys as the vulnerability management tool as it is currently being used in ACME.\nYou are expected to provide the following high level outputs for the first phase of the project:\n\uf0b7 Outline the requirements for SOAR in the context of ACME\u2019s operations.\n\uf0b7 Propose a specific SOAR solution based on your requirements.\n\uf0b7 Explain the security controls that need to be implemented for the proposed SOAR solution.\n\uf0b7 Evaluate the Azure Sentinel and Google Chronicle SIEM solutions and provide your recommendation.\nPlease explain the criteria you will be using for your analysis (you do not need to consider criteria\nwhich are not directly impacting the security operations, e.g. costs).\n\uf0b7 Explain the operational procedures the SOC team needs to create to deal with security threats.\n\uf0b7 Please explain how you will integrate different data sources into the SIEM to create a single pane of\nglass view that will provide security analysts the relevant information.\n\uf0b7 Investigate if the Qualys vulnerability management tool is the best tool for ACME and if you feel this is\nnot the right tool, please provide a gap analysis and recommend the tool that should be used.\n\uf0b7 Explain the pentesting approach and define the scope of the pentesting program.\n",

You are a senior financial adviser employed for the past\nthree years by FutureLife, with an offer for equity in the business within the next few years. With the\nbusiness having experienced exceptional growth over the past 12 months, FutureLife has decided they\nneed an additional adviser. Rather than hire outside the firm, they have opted to transition their young\nsupport staff member, Josie, into an adviser role.\nShaun\u2019s clients are predominantly self-funded retirees, with a small number who require specialised\naged care financial advice. His clients have accumulated their wealth through successful small businesses.\nShaun prefers to look after his existing clients, with any new clients referred to yourself or Emily.\nEmily\u2019s clients (age 35 to 55) are successful wealthy professionals from a mix of professional backgrounds.\nGiven their wealth, Emily has recommended self-managed superannuation funds to a number of these\nclients.\nJosie has worked in the practice in a number of support roles over the last four years while she was\ncompleting her university degree. Josie graduated 12 months ago with an approved Bachelor of Commerce\n(Financial Planning) degree. As part of her career planning, you have agreed to supervise Josie through\nher professional year, and she is currently in the third quarter of her professional year.\nYou have 10 years experience as a financial adviser and are fully qualified to provide advice on a wide range\nof strategies and products. Half of your clients followed you to FutureLife, from your previous financial\nadviser role. When Shaun or Emily is on leave, you also help out by providing advice to their clients. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------- Scenario 3 \u2014 FutureLife clients: Kevin and Anika Leste\nEmily has not been well lately and has just been diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. Her doctors have\nrecommended she take at least six months off from work to concentrate on her treatment plan, which they\nare in the process of finalising. As Emily will be away from the office for some time, she asks you to provide\nadvice for her existing clients.\nYour first meeting is with Emily\u2019s clients, Kevin and Anika Leste. You will be meeting them for the first time\nand Emily has told you they are important clients because they often recommend family, friends and their\nown clients (from their business) to the practice.\nKevin and Anika operate a successful bookkeeping business where they manage the accounts for many\nself-employed clients. There has been a longstanding referral relationship between Emily and the Lestes,\nwhich sees them share many clients. There remains frequent cross-referral of clients between Emily and\nthe Lestes; however, this arrangement has been altered due to the introduction of the Financial Planners\nand Advisers Code of Ethics 2019. Where in the past, Emily simply paid them a referral fee, she now adjusts\nher advice fees (up or down) to Kevin and Anika, in lieu of referral payments.\nThe Leste\u2019s file shows that a Statement of Advice was issued three years ago. The client notes state that\nEmily recommended the Lestes establish an SMSF, and this has now been in place for nearly three years.\nThe file notes also state they have rolled over superannuation from their previous superannuation funds\nwith AustralianSuper and Aware Super. Both funds were previously invested in the \u2018balanced\u2019 options.\nAs bookkeepers, the Lestes undertake a lot of the SMSF administration work themselves. As you read\nthrough their file, it appears they have little knowledge of investing. The only assets currently in the SMSF\nare a $1.4 million term deposit with the CBA and the SMSF administration account with about $60,000.\nYou review their goals and objectives listed in their file and note that their main goals are to build wealth\nfor their retirement and help their adult children.\nAfter introducing yourself to the Lestes, you explain that as you are not fully aware of their financial\nsituation, and as part of the review process, it would be worthwhile revisiting their current situation,\ngoals and objectives. Part-way through the meeting, Kevin takes a phone call and states he will need to\nleave immediately to take care of some urgent business, and Anika can update him later on what was\ndiscussed. However, as he leaves, he says that he just wants you to invest the money in the way you think\nis appropriate for them as \u2018Emily does this all the time\u2019.

Your header line should be complete with both the header field and the value field using the correct format. [1 mark]\n\nPart 1B\nA man-in-the-middle attack found the following HTTP Authorization header in transit.\n\nAuthorization: Basic cmljaGFyZDphcG9i\n\nWhat is the user name as seen in the above Authorization header? [1 mark]\n\nPart 1C\nAnd, what is the password seen in this Authorization header? [1 mark]\n\nPart 2\nIn this part, you will be working with HTTP's Digest authentication mechanism. Assume that accessing a resource \"\/Public\/CS\/Home.png\" on a web server results in the following (partial) response.\n\nHTTP\/1.1 401 Unauthorized\nWWW-Authenticate: Digest realm=\"Mordor\", nonce=\"03e2abb8a924e966bee59d41cef32851\", opaque=\"4043168947418128\"\n\nPart 2A\nAssuming that the user name is warner and the password is xqgd, the HTTP Authorization header line sent by the client (e.g., browser) following the above notification for authentication will be of the following form.\n\nAuthorization: Digest username=\"warner\", response=\"\", realm=\"Mordor\", nonce=\"03e2abb8a924e966bee59d41cef32851\", uri=\"\/Public\/CS\/Home.png\", opaque=\"4043168947418128\"\n\nWhat should be the value of the \"response\" field which currently is empty? Please do NOT include the quotation marks (i.e., \") in your answer. You must use lowercase hexadecimal digits in your answer, if applicable. [2 marks]\n\nPart 2B\nIn order to safeguard against server compromises, the server stores a hash value that includes the password (and other things) and uses this hash value for authentication. In this particular example here, what is the hash value you expect the server to keep in its repository? You must use lowercase hexadecimal digits in your answer, if applicable. [2 marks]\n\nPart 2C\nA man-in-the-middle attack found the following HTTP Authorization header in transit.\n\nAuthorization: Digest username=\"warner\", response=\"8172487c3ff78133dbdfb2877c20e362\", realm=\"Mordor\", nonce=\"03e2abb8a924e966bee59d41cef32851\", uri=\"\/Public\/CS\/Home.png\", opaque=\"4043168947418128\"\n\nWhat is the password that gives rise to the above HTTP Authorization header? The password is thought to be a common dictionary word, and therefore you may wish to try some of the common English words. [3 marks]\n\n\n\u270d The expected learning outcomes of this assignment are as follows.\n\nAn understanding of HTTP's Basic Authentication.\nSome understanding of base64 encoding.\nAn understanding of HTTP's Digest Authentication.\nAn appreciation of how passwords can potentially be compromised.\n\nA sample answer file that correctly follows the expected format would look like the following:\n\nAUID: 987654321\n1a: Header: Value\n1b: qwerty\n1c: qwerty\n2a: cafebabed00d\n2b: cafebabed00d\n\nplease explain how you derived each answer step by step and with great detail\n2c: qwerty",
