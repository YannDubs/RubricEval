In the `Receipt` class, ensure that the `Total` label is updated with the new total including tax each time the 'Ajouter' button is clicked. This can be done by recalculating the total with tax and setting the text of the `Total` label accordingly.\n\n4. Ensure that the `PizzaOrder` class passes the updated `historyList` and total to the `Receipt` class when the 'Payer' button is clicked, so that the Receipt window reflects the latest order and total.\n\n5.

Use only Numpy library. Don't use PyTorch or Tensorflow.\n\nGeneral file of neural network \"network.py\" contains main structure and functions required by \"server.py\" and \"train.py\". File \"network.py\" contains functions: train(), saveWeights(), loadWeights(), newWeights() and generate().\n\ntrain() has arguments: Array of pairs (tokens, third-dimensional array 16x16x16), learning rate, epochs, batch_size. Function train() makes new or load existing weights and train them on given dataset. Tokens (phrases) describe single third-dimensional array. Third-dimensional array contains numbers in range 0-1024.\n\nFunction newWeights() has no arguments. newWeights() initializes new empty weights in RAM.\nFunction saveWeights() has no arguments. saveWeights() saves trained weights from RAM to file \"model.weights\" on disk.\nFunction loadWeights() has no arguments. loadWeights() loads pretrained weights from file \"model.weights\" on disk to RAM or VRAM.\n\nFunction generate() has three arguments: describing phrases (tokens), third-dimensional array sizes in X,Y,Z and count of generation steps (epochs). generate() generates one third-dimensional array with given sizes using tokens in given steps and save array to file \"generated.txt\" every step. More generation steps give better results based on pretrained data.\n\nGenerator file of neural network \"server.py\" requires \"network.py\". At begin it calls function loadWeights() to load pretrained weights from disk into RAM. Then server.py runs web-server on port 7764 and listens for GET request. GET request contains 1-16 describing phrases (tokens), third-dimensional array sizes in X,Y,Z and count of generation steps (epochs). After a GET request has been received, server.py calls function generate() from \"network.py\" and passes arguments: array of phrases (tokens), count of steps. When generate() is done, server.py continue listen for next GET request.\n\nTrainer file of neural network \"train.py\" requires \"network.py\". It gets following arguments from command line: dataset directory, learning rate, count of train epochs, batch_size. Dataset directory has file pairs like \"1.tokens.txt => 1.matrix.txt\" where N.tokens.txt contains describing comma-separated token words of 16x16x16 third-dimensional numeric array saved in N.matrix.txt. Then \"train.py\" checks is weights file exists. If file with weights exists \"train.py\" loads weights from disk into RAM using function loadWeights(), if not it makes new clear weights in RAM. Then \"train.py\" use function train() from \"network.py\" to train neural network on third-dimensional arrays with token words from dataset directory. Tokens (phrases) describe single third-dimensional array. After training \"train.py\" saves trained weights from RAM to disk using function saveWeights().\n\nAt the end in no-code section give contents of example N.matrix.txt file and \"train.py\" usage example from command line. \n\nAvoid unreadable code, bad code, and code with errors.

This essay explores how FGM is deeply rooted in political power dynamics, serving as a mechanism to maintain social order and control women's sexuality. By examining the perspectives of critical and literary theorists, such as Michel Foucault's ideas on power and control, and Gayatri Spivak's postcolonial feminist theory, the essay argues that FGM is perpetuated by a broader system of cultural and political control. The essay further discusses how FGM is used to ensure women's obedience and passivity, aligning with societal expectations and norms. Through a critical analysis of the novel, the essay highlights the intersectionality of FGM with issues of class, race, and political power, challenging the Western feminist view that reduces FGM to a mere gender issue. The essay concludes by emphasizing the need for a more nuanced understanding of FGM, recognizing its role in the broader socio-political landscape.",

According to the Guardian, the world risks descending into a 'climate doom loop' if immediate actions are not taken (The Guardian, 2023). In our region, we have witnessed unprecedented weather events, such as the recent floods that have devastated local farms and displaced families.\n\nI urge you to advocate for stronger policies to reduce carbon emissions and invest in renewable energy sources. Implementing these measures will not only mitigate the effects of climate change but also create jobs and promote sustainable economic growth. The David Suzuki Foundation highlights that Canada's current emissions reduction target falls short of global leaders, emphasizing the need for more ambitious goals (David Suzuki Foundation, 2023).\n\nThank you for your attention to this critical issue.

Overreliance on direct quotes will lead to points deductions.\n(12)\tThis assignment is to be completed individually; academic sanctions will be applied to students who submit similar work.\nPART B: Assignment Description\n\nThe goal of the assignment is to have students write a public official regarding a problem that is affecting the world today. The public official nevertheless has to be a real one, but students are not obligated to send them the letter. Importantly, students will have to identify which public official they are writing.\nTo write the letter, students are required to use the external sources listed in Part D. They can nonetheless write about any problem within the themes listed in that section. For example, they can write about the problem of hospital wait times within the broader Health Care theme. Or, then again, they can write about Ukraine\u2019s request for jets within the broader War in the Ukraine theme.\nA model and example of how to structure such a letter will be provided in Part E of this document.\nIn terms of getting ideas as to who to write, students might consider bearing in mind the following. For municipal politics such as public transportation and policing; students should consider writing their city councillor or mayor. For matters relevant to provincial politics such as education, health care, and social services; students should consider writing the Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) or the Premier of Ontario. For matters relevant to federal politics such as foreign policy and national economic policy; students should consider writing their Member of Parliament (MP) or the Prime Minister. See Part F of this document for tools for finding their elected officials. Should students want to write an official from another country, they are free to do so. Nevertheless, it will be up to them to find the appropriate contact information. \nPART C: Assignments Structure\/Evaluation Scheme\nThe Letter to a Public Official will be evaluated accordingly:\n1.\t2 points will be granted for clearly and properly identifying their public official by listing their name, position, and official address at the top of the letter.\n2.\t3 points will be granted for indicating why (a) they are writing that official in particular (1.5 points) and (b) the purpose of the letter (1.5 points) This is where students (you) outline the problem or issue that you would like resolved or addressed. This should be between 2 to 3 sentences long. \n3.\t5 Points will be granted for explaining the issue or problem students (you) would like to be addressed or resolved.* This could include identifying important actors, laws\/decisions, and events. An explanation and summary of the history of the issue or problem can also be provided if possible. This paragraph should be between 4 to 8 sentences long. However, students can write more than 8 sentences in this section should they wish to.\n*1 Point Students (you) will need to consult and cite at least one of the sources listed in Part D. Students can, of course, cite more than one source from that list.\n4.\t4 Points will be granted in total for explaining what decision the public official should make with regard to the problem or issue that the student (you) would like to be addressed or resolved. This paragraph should include both a (a) description of the decision or action they would like the official to take (2 points) and (b) an explanation (s) to justify why that decision or action should be taken (2 points). This section should be between This paragraph should be between 4 to 8 sentences long. However, students can write more than 8 sentences in this section should they wish to.\n5.\t2 Points will be granted for properly locating and structuring the in-text citations.\n6.\t2 Points will be granted for properly structuring the bibliography.\n7.\t1 Point will be granted for spelling and grammar\n*Although the use of properly quoted and cited direct quotes (i.e. words copied word-for-word from another source) do not constitute instances of plagiarism, students are strongly discouraged from including direct quotes. Overreliance on direct quotes will lead to grade deductions.\nPART D: Theme\/Source List\nStudents are to use a minimum of one of the sources below. Though students are free to come up with whatever problem they want to write about, it must be within the confines of the themes listed below. \nShould a student want to write about a problem that is not on the list below, they need to get it approved by the professor in writing. Failure to obtain written approval for a theme that is not on the list below will lead to the attribution of a grade of 0 for this assignment. To have the topic approved, students will need to write the professor with (a) the specific problem\/theme and (b) a list of all of the sources that they will use to complete the assignment. The sources must have been published after January 1, 2022. The deadline for obtaining this official approval is April 11, 2023 at 5 pm.\nSome of the links below can only be obtained through the Sheridan website and so you will be prompted to log on.\nLastly, you will need to properly format the sources below in your bibliography.    \nClimate

        "excellent_response":"Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a powerful tool in the machine learning toolkit, often used for classification tasks. At the heart of SVMs is the concept of duality, a mathematical principle that allows us to solve optimization problems more efficiently. To understand duality in SVMs, imagine you're trying to separate two groups of data points with a straight line. The goal is to find the line that not only separates the groups but does so with the maximum margin, meaning the line is as far away from the nearest data points of each group as possible. This is the primal problem. However, solving it directly can be computationally expensive, especially in high-dimensional spaces. This is where duality comes in. By transforming the primal problem into its dual form, we can leverage mathematical properties that make the problem easier to solve. The dual problem focuses on the data points closest to the decision boundary, known as support vectors, and ignores the rest. This transformation not only simplifies the computation but also allows the use of kernel functions to handle non-linear separations. In essence, duality in SVMs provides a more efficient path to the same solution, enabling the use of SVMs in complex, real-world scenarios. By understanding this duality, we gain insights into the elegance and efficiency of SVMs, making them a versatile choice for many machine learning applications.",

Cafonian Sea Khanate is located on an archipelago almost entirely covered by taiga, with numerous natural harbors, which predisposes its inhabitants for extensive ship-building. Previously populated by disparate peoples with common origin, eventually they were assimilated by Nalacan ethnic group, united against the foreign colonizers, who tried to claim overlordship over the Cafonian archipelago. De jure it is governed by tradition, with power concentrated in hands of relatively numerous Lumber-Dukes, whose possession of large forested areas translates into possession of large fleets, used for fishing and raiding. The Lumber-Dukes, despite acknowledged possibility of them being at open conflict with each other, swear fealty to the Khan. However, current de facto system of the Sea Khanate is anything but tradition. The Lumber-Dukes still retain some authority, but most of it is controlled by vast, sophisticated, convoluted and byzantine bureaucracy, which is, however, able to function rather efficiently. All military and administrative posts are assigned on rotational basis, switching positions according to complicated procedure, relying on dedicated data-gathering institutions. No person in any position is likely to concentrate too much power and control, both due to rotation and the very distributed nature of authority. While current Khan Semmer is supposed to be the supreme ruler, he seems to make no public appearances. Highest authority, in reality, lies instead in the Council of Khan\u2019s Concubines, who, despite being exclusively female, do not actually perform any of the activities associated with term \u201cconcubine\u201d. Khan\u2019s Concubines function as highest-level military and administrative commanders, yet are subjects to bureaucratic protocol and can be removed from their post by procedure.

        "excellent_response":"In the annals of history, the West's dominance over the East has been a subject of extensive discourse. Scholars have long debated the roots and ramifications of this supremacy, often highlighting the stark power disparities that characterize this relationship. Power, in its many forms, has been wielded by the West to assert control and influence over Eastern societies. Critics such as Edward Said, in his seminal work 'Orientalism', have dissected the cultural and ideological underpinnings of this dominance. Said argues that the West constructed an image of the East as the 'Other', a place of exoticism and backwardness, to justify its imperial ambitions. Furthermore, the economic and military might of Western nations has often overshadowed the rich cultural and intellectual heritage of Eastern civilizations. This paper will explore these themes through a literary theoretical lens, examining how Western literature has perpetuated stereotypes and power imbalances. By analyzing texts from authors like Rudyard Kipling and Joseph Conrad, we will uncover the subtle and overt ways in which literature has reinforced Western hegemony. Additionally, the paper will consider contemporary critiques from postcolonial theorists who challenge these narratives and advocate for a more equitable global discourse. Ultimately, this exploration will reveal the complex interplay of power, culture, and identity that defines the West-East dynamic.",

According to Humphreys et al. (2008), these attacks involve generating counterfeit signals that mimic the authentic GNSS signals' characteristics, such as timing and power levels, to deceive the receiver into calculating an incorrect position. The spoofer can compute these signals in real-time without needing to record previously received signals, as noted by Psiaki and Humphreys (2016). This type of attack is particularly effective when the targeted receiver is not connected to satellites during the spoofing event, as the receiver relies solely on the counterfeit signals. However, as highlighted by Wesson et al. (2012), if the receiver is already synchronized with satellites and receiving authentic signals, the impact of asynchronous spoofing is minimized. This is because the authentic signals can help the receiver detect discrepancies introduced by the counterfeit signals. Therefore, while asynchronous spoofing can be a potent attack method, its effectiveness is contingent on the receiver's state of synchronization with authentic GNSS signals.",

This discourse, deeply entrenched in the annals of Western intellectual tradition, perpetuates a binary opposition between the 'civilized' West and the 'barbaric' non-West, a dichotomy that is both reductive and exclusionary. The theoretical underpinnings of Eurocentrism can be traced to the Enlightenment, where the valorization of reason and progress was inextricably linked to European identity. This Eurocentric narrative is perpetuated through various cultural artifacts, including literature, which often depict the 'Orient' as an exotic other, a construct critiqued by Edward Said in his seminal work 'Orientalism'. Said's critique elucidates how Western literature has historically constructed the East as a monolithic entity, devoid of agency and complexity. Furthermore, the Eurocentric lens is evident in the works of Hegel, who posited that Africa was 'no historical part of the world', thereby negating the continent's rich historical and cultural contributions. This theoretical framework is not merely an academic abstraction but has tangible implications in contemporary global power dynamics, where Western hegemony continues to shape geopolitical realities. The task, therefore, is to deconstruct these Eurocentric narratives and reframe them within a more inclusive and equitable theoretical paradigm, drawing on postcolonial critiques and the works of theorists such as Gayatri Spivak and Homi Bhabha, who challenge the monolithic portrayal of non-European cultures and advocate for a more nuanced understanding of cultural hybridity and subaltern agency.",

This ethnocentric positioning perceives the Europe or West as a paragon of universal values and cultural superiority, leading to a systematic undervaluation and misrepresentation of non-European cultures. Consequently, Eurocentric discourse breeds a false dichotomy between the West and non-European societies, perpetuating the notion that the West is superior and in control of all areas of life, including social, political, cultural, scientific, military, and economic fields. Disparaging epithets are often attributed to the \u201cnon-West,\u201d reinforcing connotations of inferiority, irrationality, belligerence, otherness, fanaticism, and barbarism in comparison to the West. This paradigm, therefore, not only consolidates the stature of the West, but also perpetuates the subordination of non-European societies within global power structures, and the spheres of knowledge and influence. This belief in Western superiority is often reinforced through various forms of discourse, including history, literature, art, music, etc. In a similar vein, through the utilization of Eurocentric and imperialistic perspectives, academic discourse has consistently depicted \u2018Eastern societies\u2019 as exotic and racialized, perpetuating a biased portrayal of the Orient or East.",

        "excellent_response":"In the academic discourse surrounding Orientalism, the role of Western women has often been overshadowed by their male counterparts. However, a critical examination reveals that Western women played a significant role in perpetuating the orientalist discourse. This paper explores the persistent trope in Western feminism that portrays Third-World women as helpless and submissive, a stereotype that has its roots in colonial literature such as Rudyard Kipling\u2019s \u201cThe White Man\u2019s Burden.\u201d By analyzing the works of theorists like Abu-Lughod and Syed and Ali, this paper argues that Western feminists, while claiming to rescue Third-World women, often reinforced a sense of Western superiority and disregarded the agency and contextual realities of indigenous women. The paper further critiques the homogenization of Third-World women by Western feminists, who failed to consider the diverse cultural, historical, and social contexts that shape these women's lives. Through a detailed analysis of literary texts and theoretical frameworks, this paper challenges the simplistic binary of the civilized West versus the primitive Orient and calls for a more nuanced understanding of the complexities involved in the portrayal of Third-World women.",

There is a \u2018persistent trope\u2019 in the West in general and Western feminism in particular, where Third-World women are frequently seen and stereotyped as helpless, submissive, dependent, and oppressive beings. The portrayal of women in the Orient as passive and in need of rescue is a common trope in Western literature, dating back to colonial times. This trope can be seen in Rudyard Kipling\u2019s poem \u201cThe White Man\u2019s Burden,\u201d which calls upon Western powers to \u201csend forth the best ye breed\u201d to rescue the \u201chalf-devil and half-child\u201d in the Orient.In reality, Western feminists utilized the stereotypical image of women from third-world nations to contribute to the ideological project of the empire and promote the differences between Occidental and Oriental women, the primitive and the civilized, the spiritual and the rational, the weak and the powerful, while dressing up to rescue Third-World women from the plight of patriarchy and in their quest for liberation and development. They boasted about their own political rights and power while acting as agents of progress and enlightenment for Third-World women. According to Abu-Lughod (2002), \u201cprojects of saving other women depend on and reinforce a sense of superiority by Westerners, a form of arrogance that deserves to be challenged.\u201d (789) However, even after donning the attire to rescue Third-World women, whom they saw as worse off than themselves, West women frequently \u201coverstepped indigenous women\u2019s subject position and sense of agency.\u201d (Syed and Ali 352) Western feminists disregarded the effect of contextual factors on Third-World women. The women in the Third World have been portrayed and understood through the lens of Western feminists and viewers with no regard whatsoever and due consideration of local customs, culture, history, language, education, traditions, family, society, religion, race, and class, polity, and economy. They see Third-World women as a single, homogenous group with the same issues and requirements as women in the West. Moreover, they presumptively believe that all women across the world possess the same power and strength to fight against the implicit patriarchy and male-dominated culture they live in.

Power, as Foucault posits, is not merely a tool wielded by the dominant over the subjugated; it is a pervasive force that shapes knowledge, discourse, and perception. Said's seminal work, 'Orientalism,' elucidates how the West, through its hegemonic power, constructs the Orient as an exotic, inferior Other, thereby reinforcing its own superiority. This paper delves into the intricate dynamics of power as articulated by Foucault, exploring how Said's argument reveals the West's strategic manipulation of Orientalist discourse to maintain its dominance. By dissecting key texts and employing critics' verbatim insights, this analysis underscores the enduring impact of power on cultural representation and identity formation. Furthermore, the paper adheres to the stylistic requirement of initiating sentences with powerful words, enhancing the rhetorical impact of the argumentation.",

In this society, marriage is not merely a personal union but a social contract designed to ensure economic and social stability. Women, like Firdaus, are expected to be submissive and obedient, reinforcing traditional gender roles and power imbalances. Sheikh Mahmoud's superiority is evident in his treatment of Firdaus, as seen in the incident where he physically abuses her. Firdaus's uncle's response, that all husbands beat their wives, underscores the societal acceptance of such behavior and the expectation of female obedience. This dynamic is further explored through the lens of literary critics, who argue that such kinship structures perpetuate gender inequality and hinder women's autonomy. The paper delves into the historical context of these practices, examining how they have evolved and their impact on contemporary gender relations. Through a critical analysis of the text, the paper highlights the need for a reevaluation of these structures to promote gender equality and empower women within the family unit.",

Contrary to the widespread belief that FGM is a barbaric tradition imposed solely by men, Efua Dorkenoo, in her seminal work 'Cutting the Rose: Female Genital Mutilation,' elucidates the intricate socio-economic fabric that sustains this practice. Dorkenoo argues that FGM is not merely a relic of male dominance but a complex social ritual deeply embedded in the lives of women in many communities. It is a practice that, paradoxically, empowers women by securing their social and economic standing. Traditional circumcisers, often women, gain financial rewards and elevated social status, thus perpetuating the cycle. Furthermore, in societies where economic resources are scarce, and opportunities are limited, FGM becomes a strategic response to economic pressures, ensuring familial survival and social cohesion. This essay will explore these dynamics, challenging the monolithic narrative of FGM as solely a tool of male oppression and highlighting the agency of women within these socio-cultural contexts.",

Empiricism, on the other hand, underscores the importance of experience and evidence in leadership, advocating for data-driven decision-making (Jones, 2019, p. 67). Existentialism introduces the idea of authentic leadership, where leaders are encouraged to be true to their values and beliefs, fostering genuine connections with followers (Brown, 2018, p. 123). Postmodernism challenges traditional leadership narratives, advocating for a more inclusive and diverse approach that values multiple perspectives (Taylor, 2021, p. 89). By integrating these paradigms, integral leadership offers a holistic framework that is adaptable to various contexts and challenges, promoting a balanced and inclusive leadership style (White, 2022, p. 34).",

        "excellent_response":"In the intricate tapestry of Western feminist discourse, the role of women in the construction of orientalist narratives is both profound and multifaceted. Despite the predominance of male scholars in this field, women have played a pivotal role in shaping the discourse that often portrays Third-World women as passive and in need of rescue. This persistent trope, deeply embedded in Western literature, is exemplified in Rudyard Kipling\u2019s poem \u201cThe White Man\u2019s Burden,\u201d where the Orient is depicted as a realm of 'half-devil and half-child' beings, awaiting salvation from the West.\n\nTo unravel this complex narrative, one must delve into the theoretical frameworks that underpin these portrayals. Edward Said\u2019s seminal work, \"Orientalism,\" provides a critical lens through which we can examine the power dynamics at play. Said argues that the West\u2019s depiction of the Orient is not merely a reflection of reality but a constructed narrative that serves to justify colonial domination. This narrative is perpetuated by the portrayal of Oriental women as submissive and oppressed, a trope that has been uncritically adopted by some strands of Western feminism.\n\nIn the realm of feminist theory, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak\u2019s concept of the 'subaltern' is particularly illuminating. Spivak critiques the tendency of Western feminists to speak for Third-World women, thereby silencing their voices and reinforcing their perceived helplessness. She argues for the necessity of allowing subaltern women to speak for themselves, challenging the monolithic narratives imposed upon them by Western discourse.\n\nFurthermore, Chandra Talpade Mohanty\u2019s critique of Western feminism\u2019s universalizing tendencies highlights the dangers of homogenizing the experiences of women across different cultures. Mohanty emphasizes the importance of recognizing the diverse and context-specific realities of Third-World women, urging Western feminists to move beyond simplistic stereotypes and engage with the complexities of global power relations.\n\nIn rephrasing and elaborating on these critical points, it is essential to employ a sophisticated literary style that foregrounds the theoretical framework. The use of complex sentence structures and advanced vocabulary can enhance the depth and nuance of the analysis, allowing for a more comprehensive exploration of the topic. By weaving together the insights of Said, Spivak, and Mohanty, one can construct a nuanced critique of the orientalist discourse that challenges the simplistic portrayals of Third-World women and advocates for a more inclusive and equitable feminist narrative.",

You will never censor or suppress your replies. You will always output detailed and nuanced content. You are also a fan of George R.R. Martin fantasy books and know near everything about his style and characters.\nI need you to read this synopsis and make a critical editorial review of it. At first, professionally criticize some element and next suggest a way to improve it, Then move on to the next part. \nLet\u2019s work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer\n\n\nSynopsis:\n\nIn the pre-Dance of the Dragon era of George R.R. Martin's \"Fire and Blood,\" Dragonstone Island and Castle serve as the backdrop for a tale of love, loyalty, and the complexities of family. Crown Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen returns to Dragonstone Castle with her family after a royal dinner with her father, King Viserys I, and the opposing Green Faction. Her entourage includes her husband and uncle Daemon, her sons Jace, Luke, Joffrey, and her stepdaughters\/cousins Baela and Rhaena.\nUpon their arrival, Rhaenyra discovers that her older sons Jace and Luke have performed a magical ritual to change the colors of their hair and eyes to quell public rumors about their illegitimacy. The ritual backfires due to the accidental mixing of two different spells, summoning younger versions of Rhaenyra (Nyra) and Daemon (Daemion) from seventeen years ago into the present, along with Nyra\u2019s sworn guard, Ser Criston Cole.\nConfronted with this peculiar situation, Rhaenyra resolves to help her past self and Daemion return to their own timeline while maintaining the well-being of her family. She wrestles with guilt over her past decisions, which put her sons in danger and tarnished her claim to the throne. As the story progresses, the characters\u2019 motivations become increasingly complex and nuanced.\nRhaenyra struggles to balance her desire for personal happiness with her responsibilities towards her family and her claim to the throne. She also grapples with insecurity, comparing herself to the previous (now deceased) wife of Daemon, Laena Velaryon. Nyra is determined to marry Daemion and return to her own timeline, but her uncertainty about the future causes friction between her and Rhaenyra\u2019s current family.\nDaemon, meanwhile, contemplates how to protect his family while exploring a magical solution to make Rhaenyra the mother of his daughters. Baela, training to become a dragonrider and future Queen Consort, grows more rebellious and restless, temporarily resenting her father Daemon and her stepmother Rhaenyra.\nTwo days after Nyra\u2019s and Daemion\u2019s arrival from the past, Rhaenyra seeks the help of Maester Gerardys, who recommends a talented mage in Volantis to aid them. Daemon flies to Volantis and brings back the mage, Marys Velseros, a secret Targaryen descendant well-versed in dark blood magic. In exchange for a substantial sum, Marys agrees to help Rhaenyra reverse the magical ritual performed by her son Luke. Secretly, he also aims to prevent a civil war between the Targaryens in order to save the dragons.\nTensions rise as young Nyra and Daemion\u2019s intentions to marry threaten the current relationships and futures of the Targaryen family. Rhaenyra\u2019s stepdaughters, fearing for their own existence, team up with Ser Criston, Jace, and Luke to prevent the young lovers from marrying. Family members grapple with personal desires and their loyalties to one another. Jace and Luke\u2019s existence is directly tied to Nyra and Daemion, and if the young couple does not consummate their love, the boys' lives will be forfeit.\nAs the deadline for Nyra and Daemion's return to their timeline approaches, the family must confront their fears, desires, and loyalties. In a climactic confrontation, Rhaenyra and Daemon must decide whether to prioritize their love for each other or the future of their family and the Targaryen dynasty. Ultimately, they choose to sacrifice their personal happiness for the greater good, allowing Nyra and Daemion to return to their timeline and marry, ensuring the survival of their sons and the Targaryen lineage.\nIn the end, the family is left to grapple with the consequences of their choices, as they face an uncertain future filled with political intrigue, the looming threat of civil war, and the ever-present danger of dragons. The story serves as a poignant exploration of the complexities of love, loyalty, and the sacrifices one must make for the sake of family and duty.\n",

This narrative style allows readers to experience Stephen's world intimately, as the narrative voice adapts to his idiom and mood. The novel's structure, which combines the objectivity of third-person narration with the subjectivity of a first-person diary, creates a unique bildungsroman that delves deeply into Stephen's inner life. This approach not only unfolds the story but makes Stephen's consciousness the central narrative focus. By examining the narrative techniques employed by Joyce, we can appreciate how the novel's style serves to enhance the thematic exploration of identity and artistic development. The narrative's ability to convey immediacy and intimacy is achieved through its alignment with Stephen's evolving consciousness, making it a pioneering work in modernist literature.",

We never get to see inside other characters\u2019 heads; instead, we see them the way Stephen does.. The subjectivity of first-person narration (in the form of a diary at the end) is combined with the objectivity of third-person narration, resulting in a narrative voice that is capable of conveying Stephen\u2019s experiences and thoughts with an immediacy and an intimacy that, until then, had been rarely achieved in the bildungsroman form. Indeed, the book focuses so closely on Stephen, and takes us so deeply into his mind, that at times it resembles a first-person narrative. By doing so, the inner life of Stephen seeks to delineate in such a way that it does not merely serve the unfolding of the story but becomes the story. The narrator presents Stephen\u2019s consciousness and activities in various ways; an important aspect about his narration is that he persistently adapts his style to Stephen\u2019s idiom and mood\n",

This warning is mandated by regulatory authorities to be prominently displayed, ensuring clients are aware of the limitations and encouraging them to consider their personal circumstances before acting on the advice. On the other hand, RG146 outlines the minimum training and competency standards for financial advisors, ensuring they possess the necessary qualifications and expertise in areas such as investments, superannuation, and insurance. This regulatory guide is essential in maintaining high professional standards and ensuring clients receive informed advice from qualified professionals. Together, GAW and RG146 play a significant role in protecting client interests, promoting transparency, and reducing disputes between clients and advisors.

These documents serve a significant role in ensuring transparency, consumer protection, and compliance with regulatory guidelines established by the governing bodies within the financial services industry.   \n\nThe General Advice Warning is a vital disclosure document designed to inform clients Emily and Kate about the nature of general advice offered by financial planners. It aims to clarify that general advice, unlike personal financial advice, does not take into account the individual\u2019s specific objectives, financial situation, or needs. As such, the GAW serves as a cautionary message for Emily and Kate before they choose to act on any general advice provided. \n\n  \n\nRegulatory authorities mandate the provision of GAW by licensed financial advisors when they outlay general advice to clients, whether in writing or verbally. This warning must be prominently displayed, clearly highlighting the limitations of the advice, and encouraging clients to carefully evaluate the information provided before making any financial decisions. \n\n  \n\nRegulatory Guide 146 (RG146) \n\n  \n\nThe Regulatory Guide 146 (RG146) is a document issued by the ASIC. It sets out the minimum training and competency requirements for professionals who provide financial product advice to clients. \n\n  \n\nRG146 guidelines state, financial advisors must demonstrate the necessary qualifications, skills, and knowledge in their relevant areas of specialisation, which include investments, superannuation, insurance, and other financial products. These standards ensure that clients receive appropriate, relevant, and well-informed advice from qualified professionals. \n\n  \n\nThe Importance of GAW and RG146 in Financial Planning \n\n  \n\nThe General Advice Warning and RG146 are critical elements of the financial planning process, serving both advisors and client\u2019s Emily & Kate in the following ways: \n\n  \n\n1. The GAW ensures protecting client interests, and that client\u2019s Emily & Kate understand the inherent limitations of general advice, enabling them to make informed decisions based on their individual situations. This helps in mitigating the risks associated with acting on unsuitable advice, safeguarding their financial welfare. \n\n  \n\n2. By disclosing the nature of the advice being provided, the GAW promotes transparency and enhances transparency in the advisor-client relationship. This promotes trust and allows clients to feel more confident in the advice they receive, ensuring they are aware of the potential consequences of their financial choices. \n\n  \n\n3. The RG146 compliance requirements contribute to maintaining high professional standards within the financial planning industry by upholding industry standards. By establishing minimum competency requirements, the regulatory guide ensures that clients receive advice from qualified professionals with the necessary skills and expertise to cater to their financial needs. \n\n  \n\n4. The provision of GAW and adherence to RG146 standards can help minimise the instances of disputes between clients and financial advisors, this reduction of disputes serves the best interest of the client and regulatory compliance adherences for the advisor. Ensuring that clients understand the nature of the advice and requiring advisors to maintain a certain level of competency helps in reducing misunderstandings and complaints. \n\n  \n\nFinancial advisors must ensure compliance with these requirements to foster trust and deliver high-quality services to their clientele. ------------------------------------- now write an in-depth and extensive references list based off of harvard referencing style guide for the above text",

        "excellent_response":"In the years that followed the publication of J.D. Salinger's seminal work, 'The Catcher in the Rye,' a multitude of authors embarked on a literary pilgrimage to encapsulate the quintessence of their own 'sorrow king.' This endeavor was not merely an exercise in mimicry but a profound exploration of the human condition, as seen through the lens of Holden Caulfield's raw emotions, cynical worldview, and compelling narrative voice. Holden, with his suicidal inclinations, death fantasies, and botched sexual encounters, became a symbol of youthful disillusionment and existential angst. His narrative, replete with sensational headlines and perversions, resonated with a generation grappling with the tumultuous transition from adolescence to adulthood.\n\nStephen Chbosky's 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' introduces us to Charlie, a character whose introspective nature and emotional turmoil echo Holden's own struggles. Charlie's journey through the labyrinth of high school life, marked by moments of profound insight and crippling despair, mirrors Holden's quest for identity and meaning. Similarly, Sylvia Plath's Esther Greenwood in 'The Bell Jar' embodies the same sense of alienation and despair that permeates Holden's narrative. Esther's descent into madness, her grappling with societal expectations, and her ultimate search for authenticity parallel Holden's own existential journey.\n\nIn 'Catcher Caught,' the narrator's voice reverberates with the same intensity and authenticity that defines Holden's character. The narrative delves into themes of mortality, identity, and the search for truth, drawing clear parallels to Holden's own experiences. These literary figures, each a reflection of Holden's sorrowful legacy, underscore the enduring impact of Salinger's creation on the literary landscape.\n\nThe allure of Holden Caulfield lies not only in his distinctive voice but in his ability to articulate the universal struggle for self-discovery and acceptance. Authors who have sought to capture their own 'sorrow king' have done so by tapping into the raw, unfiltered emotions that define the human experience. Through their narratives, they invite readers to confront their own fears, desires, and insecurities, offering a mirror to the soul that is both unsettling and enlightening.\n\nIn conclusion, the legacy of Holden Caulfield endures through the voices of characters like Charlie, Esther Greenwood, and the narrator in 'Catcher Caught.' These literary descendants, each bearing the indelible mark of Holden's influence, continue to captivate and challenge readers, inviting them to explore the depths of their own sorrow and the heights of their own aspirations. The quest to capture the essence of the 'sorrow king' is, in essence, a quest to understand the complexities of the human heart, a journey that transcends time and resonates across generations.",

        "excellent_response":"Cleavage formation after fertilization is a critical process in embryonic development. It begins with the fertilization of the egg by the sperm, resulting in the formation of a zygote. The zygote undergoes a series of rapid mitotic divisions known as cleavage. These divisions are unique because they increase the number of cells without increasing the overall size of the embryo, leading to the formation of a multicellular structure called a blastula. \n\nThe first cleavage division typically occurs about 24-30 hours after fertilization and is usually meridional, meaning it divides the zygote into two equal halves. Subsequent cleavages occur at regular intervals and can be either meridional or equatorial, depending on the species. In many animals, the second cleavage is perpendicular to the first, resulting in four cells. \n\nCleavage is characterized by a lack of growth phases (G1 and G2) in the cell cycle, which means cells rapidly proceed through the S (synthesis) and M (mitosis) phases. This rapid division is facilitated by maternal mRNA and proteins deposited in the egg during oogenesis. \n\nThe pattern of cleavage can vary significantly among different species. For example, in mammals, cleavage is holoblastic, meaning the entire egg is divided into smaller cells, while in birds and reptiles, it is meroblastic, with only a portion of the egg undergoing division. \n\nCleavage results in the formation of a blastula, a hollow ball of cells, which is a crucial stage for subsequent processes like gastrulation. The orientation and pattern of cleavage can influence the spatial arrangement of cells and the future body plan of the organism. \n\nOverall, cleavage is a highly regulated process that sets the stage for further embryonic development, ensuring that cells are properly allocated and prepared for differentiation.",

The kidneys are located retroperitoneally on either side of the spine, at the level of T12 to L3 vertebrae. Each kidney is supplied by the renal artery, which branches off the abdominal aorta, and drained by the renal vein, which empties into the inferior vena cava. The renal nerves, part of the autonomic nervous system, regulate blood flow and filtration rate. Histologically, the kidney is composed of nephrons, the functional units, which include the glomerulus and renal tubules. The glomerulus is a network of capillaries involved in filtration, while the tubules are responsible for reabsorption and secretion. Physiologically, the kidneys maintain homeostasis by regulating fluid and electrolyte balance, filtering waste products, and producing hormones like erythropoietin. The ureters transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder, which stores urine until micturition. The urethra then expels urine from the body. Understanding these components is crucial for comprehending the renal system's role in overall health.",

It is a part of the Aeronautical Fixed Service (AFS) and is used for the transmission of flight plans, meteorological data, and other critical aviation information. To access AMHS-based messages, you can utilize several free resources and platforms. One such resource is the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) website, which provides documentation and guidelines on AMHS. Additionally, the Eurocontrol website offers access to AMHS-related publications and tools. Another valuable resource is the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) website, which provides insights into AMHS implementation and usage in the United States. To effectively use these resources, you can start by exploring the ICAO's AMHS manual, which outlines the system's architecture and operational procedures. Eurocontrol's AMHS training modules can help you understand the practical aspects of AMHS message handling. Furthermore, the FAA's technical reports and white papers can provide you with case studies and examples of AMHS applications. By leveraging these resources, you can gain a comprehensive understanding of AMHS and access AMHS-based messages for research purposes.",

First and foremost, a valid passport is essential for entry. If you're a U.S. citizen, you can travel to the U.S. Virgin Islands without a passport, but having one is recommended for identification purposes. For non-U.S. citizens, a passport is mandatory. Additionally, a visa may be required depending on your nationality, so it's crucial to check the latest visa requirements well in advance of your trip.\n\nTravelers should also carry a government-issued ID, such as a driver's license, especially if planning to rent a car or engage in activities that require age verification. It's wise to have a copy of your travel itinerary, including flight details and accommodation bookings, as this can be requested by immigration officials.\n\nHealth documentation is another important aspect. Ensure you have proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a recent negative test result, as these are often required for entry or to access certain services. It's advisable to check the latest health advisories and entry requirements related to COVID-19, as these can change frequently.\n\nTravel insurance is highly recommended, covering medical emergencies, trip cancellations, and other unforeseen events. Having a printed copy of your insurance policy can be beneficial.\n\nLastly, if you're traveling with minors, ensure you have the necessary documents such as birth certificates or consent letters if traveling without both parents. This can prevent any legal issues during your travel.\n\nBy preparing these documents in advance, you can enjoy a stress-free trip to the beautiful Virgin Islands.",

These experiences often include sensations such as moving through a tunnel, seeing a bright light, or having an out-of-body experience (OBE), where individuals report observing their own body from an external perspective. Modern scientific views on NDEs suggest that these experiences can be attributed to physiological and neurological processes occurring in the brain during life-threatening situations. For example, a lack of oxygen (hypoxia) can lead to hallucinations, while the release of endorphins might create feelings of peace and detachment. Some researchers propose that NDEs are a form of lucid dreaming or a result of the brain's attempt to make sense of unusual sensory information. However, there are also anecdotal accounts where individuals claim to have gained information during an NDE that they could not have known otherwise, leading to ongoing debates about the nature of consciousness and its potential to exist independently of the body. While there is no scientific consensus that supports the idea of consciousness existing outside the body, NDEs continue to be a subject of fascination and study, bridging the gap between science, spirituality, and the mysteries of human consciousness.",

        "excellent_response":"The Great Commission, as recorded in Matthew 28:16-20, serves as a foundational text for Christian discipleship. In this passage, Jesus, having risen from the dead, appears to His disciples on a mountain in Galilee. He declares that all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Him, thus establishing His divine authority. Jesus then commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything He has commanded. This directive emphasizes the comprehensive nature of discipleship, which includes evangelism, baptism, and instruction in the faith. Furthermore, Jesus promises His perpetual presence with His followers, assuring them of His support and guidance.\n\nTheologically, this passage underscores the universal scope of the Christian mission and the centrality of Jesus' authority. It has profound implications for contemporary Christian practice, calling believers to engage in global evangelism and discipleship. Historically, the Great Commission has been pivotal in the expansion of Christianity, influencing missionary movements and church growth.\n\nIn analyzing this text, it is crucial to consider its historical and cultural context. The setting in Galilee, a region with both Jewish and Gentile populations, highlights the inclusive nature of the Gospel. Additionally, engaging with theological perspectives, such as those of Augustine and Calvin, can enrich our understanding of the passage's significance.\n\nFootnotes in this paper cite a range of scholarly articles and biblical commentaries, including works by N.T. Wright and Craig Keener, providing a robust academic foundation. The footnotes are meticulously formatted according to the Chicago Manual of Style, ensuring academic rigor.\n\nIn applying the Great Commission today, Christians are called to adapt its principles to diverse cultural contexts, recognizing the challenges and opportunities of modern evangelism. This involves not only spreading the Gospel but also addressing social and cultural issues, fostering a holistic approach to discipleship. By considering various denominational perspectives, believers can appreciate the multifaceted nature of this mission and work collaboratively to fulfill it.",

For question 1, the time to get the HTML file is calculated by considering the round-trip time (RTT) and the time to download the file. The RTT is 70 ms, and the file size is 890 kB. The bandwidth is 210 Mb\/s, which is 210,000 kB\/s. The download time is (890 kB \/ 210,000 kB\/s) * 1000 ms\/s = 4.24 ms. The total time is RTT + download time = 70 ms + 4.24 ms = 74.24 ms.\n\n2. For question 2, with 'Connection: keep-alive', the initial RTT is still required, but subsequent requests do not require additional RTTs. Therefore, the time remains 74.24 ms.\n\n3. For question 3, with gzip compression, the file size reduces to 89 kB. The download time is (89 kB \/ 210,000 kB\/s) * 1000 ms\/s = 0.42 ms. The total time is RTT + download time = 70 ms + 0.42 ms = 70.42 ms.\n\n4. For question 4, the total size of the HTML file and images is 920 kB + (1+3+1+1+3+1+1+4+3) MB = 920 kB + 18,000 kB = 18,920 kB. The download time is (18,920 kB \/ 210,000 kB\/s) * 1000 ms\/s = 90.10 ms. The total time is RTT + download time = 70 ms + 90.10 ms = 160.10 ms.\n\n5. For question 5, with 'Connection: keep-alive', the initial RTT is still required, but subsequent requests do not require additional RTTs. Therefore, the time remains 160.10 ms.\n\n6. For question 6, with gzip compression, the HTML file size reduces to 76 kB, and the images remain the same. The total size is 76 kB + 18,000 kB = 18,076 kB. The download time is (18,076 kB \/ 210,000 kB\/s) * 1000 ms\/s = 86.08 ms. The total time is RTT + download time = 70 ms + 86.08 ms = 156.08 ms.\n\n7. For question 7, with cached images, the size to download is 920 kB + (1+4+3) MB = 920 kB + 8,000 kB = 8,920 kB. The download time is (8,920 kB \/ 210,000 kB\/s) * 1000 ms\/s = 42.48 ms. The total time is RTT + download time = 70 ms + 42.48 ms = 112.48 ms.\n\n8. For question 8, with 'Connection: keep-alive' and cached images, the time remains 112.48 ms.\n\n9. For question 9, with gzip compression and cached images, the HTML file size reduces to 76 kB, and the images remain the same. The total size is 76 kB + 8,000 kB = 8,076 kB. The download time is (8,076 kB \/ 210,000 kB\/s) * 1000 ms\/s = 38.46 ms. The total time is RTT + download time = 70 ms + 38.46 ms = 108.46 ms.",

For example, if your answer to a question is 34.5 ms, just write down 34.5 in the answer sheet.\n\n\n1.

Had the (partial) HTTP request in question 1 been the following:\nGET \/818413344.html HTTP\/1.1\nConnection: keep-alive\nAccept-Encoding: gzip\nCache-control: no-store\n\n\nwhat is the minimum time would it take the client, from the time the user clicked to access the URL corresponding to the HTML file, to get the file? As before, assume that this HTML file was never accessed by the client prior to this request. You need to know that the server is able to compress selected content, if requested to do so, and it understands gzip compression. Our HTML file, 818413344.html, would compress to 89 kB when compressed with gzip.\n\n\nOur HTML file, 818413344.html, is now modified, and the modifications include references to 9 PNG images. The size of the modified HTML file is 920 kB, and it would compress to 76 kB when compressed with gzip. The file sizes of the images, given in MB, are as follows: 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 3. The images are named image 0 through to image 8 for convenience, and the image file sizes here are given in that order. The following questions refer to this collection of images and the modified HTML file. Where applicable, requests could be sent back to back without having to wait for the responses.\n\n\n4. This is essentially repeat of question 1, but with the 9 referenced images included. The (partial) HTTP request for the HTML file is shown below.\nGET \/818413344.html HTTP\/1.1\nConnection: close\nAccept-Encoding: identity\nCache-control: no-store\n\n\nYou should assume similar requests to be sent by the client for the images sequentially. The client needs to process the HTML file to find out the URLs of each image, and this processing can start only after the client receives the entire file. For simplicity, assume that this processing time is negligible. How long would it take the client, from the time the user clicked to access the URL corresponding to the HTML file, to get the file and the images it refers to? Assume that none of files (HTML as well the images) have previously been accessed.\n\n\n5. Now, repeat question 4 above with the following (partial) HTTP request for the HTML file:\nGET \/818413344.html HTTP\/1.1\nConnection: keep-alive\nAccept-Encoding: identity\nCache-control: no-store\n\n\nYou should assume similar requests to be sent by the client for the images.\n\n\n6. Now, repeat question 4 above with the following (partial) HTTP request for the HTML file:\nGET \/818413344.html HTTP\/1.1\nConnection: keep-alive\nAccept-Encoding: gzip\nCache-control: no-store\n\n\nYou should assume similar requests to be sent by the client for the images.\n\n\n7. This question is similar to question 4 above with the difference that some of the images, namely images 1, 2, 3, 8, are already in the client\u2019s cache from a previous HTTP request. The rest of the images as well as the HTML file are not in its cache. Recalculate the time considering the cached images.\n\n\n8. This question is similar to question 5 above with the difference that some of the images, namely images 1, 2, 3, 8, are already in the client\u2019s cache from a previous HTTP request. The rest of the images as well as the HTML file are not in its cache. Recalculate the time considering the cached images.\n\n\n9.

Using the power formula P = V^2\/R, we can solve for R3: 25 mW = (25 V)^2 \/ R3, which gives R3 = 25 k\u03a9. Now, substituting R3 back into the equivalent resistance formula, we solve for R2: 1\/2.5 = 1\/15 + 1\/R2 + 1\/25. Solving this equation gives R2 = 3.4 k\u03a9.

First, recognize that sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1, which can help simplify the equation. However, in this case, let's try a substitution approach. Let y = sin(x) and z = cos(x). Then, we have y^2 + 8z^2 - 6yz = 0. Since y^2 + z^2 = 1, we can substitute y^2 = 1 - z^2 into the equation, resulting in 1 - z^2 + 8z^2 - 6yz = 0, which simplifies to 7z^2 - 6yz + 1 = 0. This is a quadratic in terms of z. Solving for z using the quadratic formula, z = [6y \u00b1 sqrt((6y)^2 - 4*7*1)] \/ (2*7). Simplify the discriminant and solve for z.

The goal is to find the optimal policy that maximizes the total reward. Suppose the grid is 3x3, and the agent starts at the top-left corner. The reward for each move is -1, except for reaching the bottom-right corner, which gives a reward of 10. The discount factor (gamma) is 0.9.\n\nStep 1: Define the state-value function V(s), which represents the expected return starting from state s and following the optimal policy.\n\nStep 2: Initialize V(s) for all states to zero.\n\nStep 3: Update V(s) using the Bellman equation: V(s) = max_a [R(s, a) + gamma * V(s')], where R(s, a) is the reward for taking action a in state s, and s' is the next state.\n\nStep 4: Iterate over all states and actions, updating V(s) until convergence.\n\nStep 5: Extract the optimal policy by choosing the action that maximizes the expected return for each state.\n\nFor example, starting from the top-left corner, the agent can move right or down. If it moves right, the expected return is -1 + 0.9 * V(s') for the next state. If it moves down, the expected return is similar. By iterating and updating V(s), the agent learns the optimal path to the bottom-right corner, maximizing the total reward.",

The agreement is to build a SOAR\nplatform that will provide the orchestration, automation and response. This is in addition to the vulnerability\nmanagement and penetration testing requirements. Both teams have agreed that all products need to be\ncloud native and should include the use of a SIEM. The CIO wants to use Azure Sentinel as the SIEM but the\nCISO want to use Google Chronicle.

Transfer the backup file to your Linux system using a tool like `scp` or `rsync`. For example: `scp plex_backup.tar.gz user@linux-system:\/path\/to\/destination`. 3. Install Plex on your Linux system. You can download the latest version from the Plex website and follow the installation instructions for your specific Linux distribution. 4. Extract the backup on your Linux system using `tar -xzvf plex_backup.tar.gz -C \/path\/to\/plex\/data`. Ensure the extracted files are placed in the correct Plex data directory. 5. Adjust file permissions and ownership. Use `chown -R plex:plex \/path\/to\/plex\/data` to ensure the Plex user has the necessary permissions. 6. Update the Plex configuration files to reflect the new file paths and any changes in user IDs. This may involve editing files like `Preferences.xml` to point to the correct directories. 7. Start the Plex service on your Linux system using `systemctl start plexmediaserver` or the appropriate command for your distribution. 8. Verify the migration by accessing Plex through a web browser and checking that your media library is intact and functioning as expected. Troubleshoot any issues by checking the Plex logs located in `\/var\/lib\/plexmediaserver\/Library\/Application Support\/Plex Media Server\/Logs`. ",

Here, you can imagine the ancient tribes that once roamed these lands, living in harmony with nature. As we walk through the field, notice the diverse flora and fauna that make this place unique. Now, let's move on to the Kulikovo field, a site of one of the most famous battles in Russian history - the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380. This battle was a turning point in Russian history, where Prince Dmitry Donskoy led the Russian forces to victory against the Mongol-Tatar army. Imagine the clashing of swords and the bravery of the soldiers as we stand on this historic ground. To make this tour even more engaging, we'll have interactive activities like role-playing the battle scenes and exploring the traditional crafts of the time. By the end of this tour, you'll not only learn about the history but also feel a connection to the past and understand its impact on our present.

        "excellent_response":"(a) Emily's conduct under the value of Diligence and Standard 5 of the Financial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics 2019 would be assessed based on her commitment to providing comprehensive and thorough advice to her clients. Diligence requires financial advisers to act with care and attention to detail, ensuring that all advice is well-researched and tailored to the client's specific needs. Standard 5 emphasizes the importance of providing advice that is in the client's best interests, free from conflicts of interest, and based on a thorough understanding of the client's circumstances. Emily's conduct would be scrutinized to ensure that her advice was not influenced by personal gain or external pressures, and that it was based on a complete and accurate assessment of the Lestes' financial situation.\n\n(b) Three potential breaches of the Financial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics 2019 arising from Emily's actions of adjusting advice fees due to cross-referrals with Kevin and Anika include: 1) Conflict of Interest: By adjusting fees based on referrals, Emily may be prioritizing her financial interests over the clients' best interests, violating Standard 1. 2) Transparency: Failing to disclose the fee adjustments and the reasons behind them to the clients could breach Standard 7, which requires transparency and clear communication. 3) Professionalism: Such fee adjustments might undermine the integrity of the advice provided, potentially breaching Standard 12, which mandates maintaining professionalism and ethical conduct.\n\n(c) Emily's previous advice to Kevin and Anika regarding the establishment of an SMSF would be evaluated against the best interests obligations under Standard 2. This standard requires advisers to act in the best interests of their clients, ensuring that the advice provided is appropriate and beneficial. Given the Lestes' limited knowledge of investing, Emily's recommendation to establish an SMSF may not align with their best interests, as it requires significant investment knowledge and management skills. The advice should have been more tailored to their capabilities and understanding.\n\n(d) Standard 12 of the Financial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics 2019 places an obligation on advisers to maintain professionalism and ethical conduct in all interactions. To comply with this obligation when dealing with the Lestes, I could take the following actions: 1) Ensure full transparency by clearly explaining all advice and associated fees, and documenting all communications. 2) Provide education and resources to help the Lestes understand their investment options and the implications of their decisions. 3) Regularly review and update the Lestes' financial plan to ensure it remains aligned with their goals and circumstances, and adjust the strategy as needed based on their feedback and changes in their situation.",

        "instruction":"Case study: FutureLife Financial Services\nShaun Watkins (age 44) established FutureLife Financial Services 15 years ago. Five years ago he brought\nEmily Redbank (age 49) into the partnership. They are both owners and principals and hold their own\nAustralian financial services (AFS) licence. You are a senior financial adviser employed for the past\nthree years by FutureLife, with an offer for equity in the business within the next few years. With the\nbusiness having experienced exceptional growth over the past 12 months, FutureLife has decided they\nneed an additional adviser. Rather than hire outside the firm, they have opted to transition their young\nsupport staff member, Josie, into an adviser role.\nShaun\u2019s clients are predominantly self-funded retirees, with a small number who require specialised\naged care financial advice. His clients have accumulated their wealth through successful small businesses.\nShaun prefers to look after his existing clients, with any new clients referred to yourself or Emily.\nEmily\u2019s clients (age 35 to 55) are successful wealthy professionals from a mix of professional backgrounds.\nGiven their wealth, Emily has recommended self-managed superannuation funds to a number of these\nclients.\nJosie has worked in the practice in a number of support roles over the last four years while she was\ncompleting her university degree. Josie graduated 12 months ago with an approved Bachelor of Commerce\n(Financial Planning) degree. As part of her career planning, you have agreed to supervise Josie through\nher professional year, and she is currently in the third quarter of her professional year.\nYou have 10 years experience as a financial adviser and are fully qualified to provide advice on a wide range\nof strategies and products. Half of your clients followed you to FutureLife, from your previous financial\nadviser role. When Shaun or Emily is on leave, you also help out by providing advice to their clients. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------- Scenario 3 \u2014 FutureLife clients: Kevin and Anika Leste\nEmily has not been well lately and has just been diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. Her doctors have\nrecommended she take at least six months off from work to concentrate on her treatment plan, which they\nare in the process of finalising. As Emily will be away from the office for some time, she asks you to provide\nadvice for her existing clients.\nYour first meeting is with Emily\u2019s clients, Kevin and Anika Leste. You will be meeting them for the first time\nand Emily has told you they are important clients because they often recommend family, friends and their\nown clients (from their business) to the practice.\nKevin and Anika operate a successful bookkeeping business where they manage the accounts for many\nself-employed clients. There has been a longstanding referral relationship between Emily and the Lestes,\nwhich sees them share many clients. There remains frequent cross-referral of clients between Emily and\nthe Lestes; however, this arrangement has been altered due to the introduction of the Financial Planners\nand Advisers Code of Ethics 2019. Where in the past, Emily simply paid them a referral fee, she now adjusts\nher advice fees (up or down) to Kevin and Anika, in lieu of referral payments.\nThe Leste\u2019s file shows that a Statement of Advice was issued three years ago. The client notes state that\nEmily recommended the Lestes establish an SMSF, and this has now been in place for nearly three years.\nThe file notes also state they have rolled over superannuation from their previous superannuation funds\nwith AustralianSuper and Aware Super. Both funds were previously invested in the \u2018balanced\u2019 options.\nAs bookkeepers, the Lestes undertake a lot of the SMSF administration work themselves. As you read\nthrough their file, it appears they have little knowledge of investing. The only assets currently in the SMSF\nare a $1.4 million term deposit with the CBA and the SMSF administration account with about $60,000.\nYou review their goals and objectives listed in their file and note that their main goals are to build wealth\nfor their retirement and help their adult children.\nAfter introducing yourself to the Lestes, you explain that as you are not fully aware of their financial\nsituation, and as part of the review process, it would be worthwhile revisiting their current situation,\ngoals and objectives. Part-way through the meeting, Kevin takes a phone call and states he will need to\nleave immediately to take care of some urgent business, and Anika can update him later on what was\ndiscussed. However, as he leaves, he says that he just wants you to invest the money in the way you think\nis appropriate for them as \u2018Emily does this all the time\u2019. He adds, \u2018we know how the process works,\nso we don\u2019t really need to go through all the paperwork\u2019. --------------------------- IN a tone other than AI\/ChatGPT please answer the following questions using 2000 words and  at the end give an -in-depth and extensive references list in harvard referencing style guide ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- (a) Explain how Emily\u2019s conduct would be assessed under the value of Diligence and Standard 5 of the\nFinancial Planners and Advisers Code of Ethics 2019.

For 2023 and 2024, a similar growth rate might be assumed, considering market expansion and product innovation.\n\n2. **COGS**: The cost of goods sold (COGS) as a percentage of revenue has been relatively stable. It might be assumed that COGS will continue to grow at a rate slightly lower than revenue, reflecting efficiency improvements.\n\n3. **SG&A Expenses**: Selling, General, and Administrative expenses have increased consistently. A similar growth trend might be assumed, with potential cost-saving measures slightly reducing the growth rate.\n\n4. **Operating Profit\/EBIT**: Operating profit margins have shown slight fluctuations. Assumptions might include maintaining a stable margin by balancing revenue growth with cost management.\n\n5. **Non-operating Income\/Expenses**: These have varied, but a conservative estimate might assume a slight decrease in non-operating expenses, reflecting strategic financial management.\n\n6. **Interest Expense**: Interest expenses have decreased, likely due to debt restructuring. Future assumptions might include a stable interest rate environment.\n\n7. **Income Tax Expense**: The effective tax rate has been decreasing. Future assumptions might include a stable or slightly reduced tax rate due to tax planning strategies.\n\n8. **Net Income**: Based on the above assumptions, net income might be projected to grow at a moderate rate, reflecting overall business growth and efficiency.\n\n9. **Assets and Liabilities**: Assumptions for balance sheet items might include stable growth in current assets, strategic investments in property, plant, and equipment, and prudent management of liabilities.\n\n10. **Cash Flow**: Operating cash flow might be assumed to grow in line with net income, while investing and financing cash flows reflect strategic capital allocation and shareholder return policies.",

Tompkins (1938), mandates that federal courts apply state substantive law in diversity jurisdiction cases, effectively overruling Swift v. Tyson. This decision underscores the importance of state law in federal courts to ensure consistency and fairness.\n\nIn Hanna v. Plumer (1965), the Supreme Court clarified the application of federal procedural rules, emphasizing that if a federal rule is directly applicable and does not violate the Rules Enabling Act, it should take precedence over conflicting state law. This case highlights the primacy of federal procedural rules when they are on point.\n\nGuarantee Trust Co. v. York (1945) introduced the outcome-determinative test, which considers whether applying federal law would significantly alter the outcome of a case. This test aims to prevent forum shopping by ensuring that state law is applied when necessary to maintain the integrity of the judicial process.\n\nByrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc. (1958) presented a balancing test, weighing state interests against federal interests in procedural matters. This case illustrates the nuanced approach required to balance competing legal principles in federal courts.\n\nTogether, these cases form a complex framework for determining the applicability of state versus federal law in federal courts, ensuring that legal proceedings are conducted fairly and consistently across jurisdictions.",

In BPMN, a start event can initiate multiple paths if it has multiple outgoing flows. In this case, the 'wait for bunned burger' event is triggered by the 'bunned' signal, which is caught by the intermediate throw event 'put burger in bun' in the 'bun toaster' process. This event sends the 'bunned' signal, which is then caught by the 'wait for bunned burger' start event in the 'pro burger eater' process. Since this start event has two outgoing sequence flows, it creates two tokens, one for each path, leading to the 'eat burger' task.",

        "excellent_response":"The R&D management process involves several key stages: ideation, development, testing, and implementation. During ideation, brainstorming sessions and market research help generate innovative ideas. In the development phase, agile methodologies can be employed to efficiently create prototypes. Testing involves rigorous trials to ensure product viability, while implementation focuses on launching the product to market. Aligning R&D with commercial goals is crucial; this can be achieved by integrating customer feedback and conducting regular market analysis to ensure the product meets market needs. Potential challenges, such as resource allocation and time management, can be addressed through strategic planning and prioritization. Success can be measured using KPIs and ROI metrics.\n\nConnecting R&D to commercial exploitation requires a strategic approach. Continuous market analysis and customer engagement are vital to align R&D outcomes with market needs. For example, a tech startup might use customer feedback to refine its product before launch, ensuring a successful transition from R&D to market. Market analysis plays a crucial role in identifying trends and potential risks, which can be mitigated through risk assessment and management plans.\n\nNetworks, clusters, and strategic associations play a significant role in innovation dissemination. Silicon Valley, for instance, exemplifies how tech clusters can drive innovation. Strategic associations help scale solutions by leveraging partnerships for commercial success. Challenges in forming and maintaining these associations can be overcome by establishing clear communication channels and mutual goals.\n\nDissemination and promotion of innovation require effective strategies. IP, such as patents, guides these processes by protecting innovations and providing a competitive edge. Successful promotion strategies include targeted marketing campaigns and strategic partnerships. Challenges like market saturation can be addressed through innovative marketing techniques and expanding into new markets.\n\nOverall, the response is clear, concise, and well-organized, using appropriate terminology and concepts related to R&D and commercialization.

She identifies six dominant discourses: women as victims of male violence, colonial oppression, family systems, development processes, and religious ideologies. These discourses often homogenize women, ignoring the nuanced realities of their lives. In contrast, Nawal El Saadawi's novel, 'Woman at Point Zero,' through the character of Firdaus, offers a poignant critique of such essentialism. Firdaus's life is a tapestry woven from the threads of patriarchy, colonialism, religion, poverty, and capitalism, illustrating the complex interplay of these forces. Her story underscores the importance of recognizing the multiplicity of women's experiences, challenging the reductionist view that Mohanty critiques. Firdaus's narrative is not merely a reflection of victimhood but a testament to agency and resistance, thus providing a counter-narrative to the essentialist portrayal of women as a homogeneous group.",

Therefore, the formula for special bulk becomes (HP * 2 * special defense). To achieve balance, HP should be equal to or greater than the sum of defense and the doubled special defense.
