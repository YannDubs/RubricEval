Think of a transformer called MyT that has the following architecture:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $57$ transformer blocks, i.e. $N$ in the figure.
    \item model dimensionality of $d=1756$, i.e. all the inputs, outputs and activations of transformer blocks are vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. In particular, the Key, Value, Query, and Output matrices are in $\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$.
    \item a max context length of $C=2800$, i.e. there are $C$ positional embeddings in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$.
    \item 439 attention heads.
    \item normalization layers are RMSNorm
    \item a vocabulary size of $V=63257$, i.e., there are $V$ input embeddings in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$, and the last linear layer is a softmax over $V$ classes.
    \item the feedforward model is two layer MLP with temporary hidden activations of size $\mathbb{R}^{4*d}$, i.e. the computational graph is $input\ (\mathbb{R}^{d}) \to \mathrm{\mathbf{linear}} \to tmp\ (\mathbb{R}^{4*d}) \to \mathrm{\mathbf{ReLU}} \to tmp\ (\mathbb{R}^{4*d}) \to \mathrm{\mathbf{linear}}  \to output\ (\mathbb{R}^{d})$ where layers are in bold and there's no bias in Linear layers.
\end{itemize}

Where do most of the parameters come from in MyT?
Your answer should be one of the following:
The input embeddings, the positional embeddings, all the multi-head attention blocks, all the normalization layers, all the feedforward blocks, the final linear layer. How many parameters does that part have?
# <expert_solution>:
Feedforward blocks require $2*4*LD^2$ parameters which is the bottleneck (2 layers per block, each with $4D^2$ parameters). In contrast, all the self-attention layers require $4LD^2$ parameters (one for K,V,Q,O). All other layers have a negligible amount of parameters as they either don't have matrix parameters (e.g. activation / normalization layers) or no dependencies on the number of layers (e.g. embeddings and last layer). Putting all the numbers in, we have $2*4*1756^2*57 = 1406092416$ parameters for the feedforward blocks.
