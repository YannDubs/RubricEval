The Least Squares objective is denoted by:

\begin{align*}
    \argmin_{w} \quad ( Y - Xw)^T(Y - Xw)
\end{align*}

where $Y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ are the targets, $w \in \mathbb{R}^d$ are the parameters, and $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ is the feature matrix.\\

The Ridge-regression regularized objective is:
\begin{align*}
\argmin_{w} \quad (Y - Xw)^T(Y - Xw) + \lambda w^Tw
\end{align*}

Show that $||w^*_l ||_2^2 \geq ||w^*_r ||_2^2$. Where $w^*_l$ and $w^*_r$ respectively denote the optimal solution for the least squares objective and the ridge regression objective.

The instruction asks to show that regularization shrinks coefficients. Intuitively, this makes sense as the term $\lambda w^Tw$ penalizes large coefficients, making the optimization prefer smaller solutions. Indeed, tt can be seen as a Lagrangian relaxation of a constrained optimization problem where the norm of the coefficients is bounded, thus the norm will be at least as small as the norm of the solution to the unconstrained problem. Now let's prove it.

Let $X$ be a fixed design matrix and $Y$ a fixed response vector. Let $X = U \Sigma V^{T}$ be the SVD of $X$ and $X^{T} X = U \Lambda U^{T}$ be the eigendecomposition of $X^{T} X$, where $\Lambda$ has non-negative entries (since $X^{T} X$ is positive semidefinite), and $\Sigma^2 = \Lambda$. Recall that $U$ and $V$ are orthogonal matrices, and that $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma$ are diagonal.

The ridge estimator with penalty parameter $\lambda$ has coefficients (this is the normal equation for ridge regression)
$$\hat{w}_{\text{ridge}}^{\lambda} = (X^{T} X + \lambda I)^{-1} X^{T} Y.$$
We can compute its squared norm by plugging in the factorization above.
$$\|\hat{w}_{\text{ridge}}^{\lambda}\|^{2} = (\hat{w}_{\text{ridge}}^{\lambda})^{T}\hat{w}_{\text{ridge}}^{\lambda} = Y^{T} X (X^{T} X + \lambda I)^{-2} X^{T} Y$$
where we use the fact that $X^T X$ is a symmetric matrix and therefore $X^T X + \lambda I$ is also symmetric, so its inverse is also symmetric and $(X^{T} X + \lambda I)^{-1}^T=(X^{T} X + \lambda I)^{-1}$. Now let's use the eigen-decomposition of $X^T X$ and SVD of $X$.
$$ = Y^{T} V \Sigma U^{T} (U \Lambda U^{T} + \lambda I)^{-2} U \Sigma V^{T} Y$$
$$ = Y^{T} V \Sigma U^{T} (U (\Lambda + \lambda I) U^{T} )^{-2} U \Sigma V^{T} Y$$
where we use the fact that $U$ is an orthogonal matrix and therefore $U U^T = I$.
$$ = Y^{T} V \Sigma U^{T} (U (\Lambda + \lambda I)^{-2} U^{T} ) U \Sigma V^{T} Y$$
where we use the fact that for symmetric matrices, powers can be directly applied to the eigenvalue matrix.
$$ = Y^{T} V \frac{\Sigma^{2}}{(\Lambda + \lambda I)^{2}} V^{T} Y.$$
Where the last line abuses notation a bit by writing these matrices as a fraction, but really just means pointwise division of their elements since all of the matrices involved are diagonal. Next, substituting in that the eigenvalues of $X^{T} X$ are the squared singular values of $X$, we have
$$= Y^{T} V \frac{ \Lambda}{(\Lambda + \lambda I)^{2}} V^{T} Y.$$
Denote $V^{T} Y$ by $a$. We have
$$Y^{T} V \frac{ \Lambda}{(\Lambda + \lambda I)^{2}} V^{T} Y = a^{T} \frac{ \Lambda}{(\Lambda + \lambda I)^{2}} a$$
$$ = \sum_{i=1}^{p} \frac{\Lambda_{i,i}}{(\Lambda_{i,i} + \lambda)^{2}} a_{i}^{2}.$$

Therefore, for two penalty parameters, $\lambda_{1} \leq \lambda_{2}$, we have
$$\|\hat{w}_{\text{ridge}}^{\lambda_{2}}\|^{2} \leq \|\hat{w}_{\text{ridge}}^{\lambda_{1}}\|^{2}  \iff \sum_{i=1}^{p} \frac{\Lambda_{i,i}}{(\Lambda_{i,i} + \lambda_{2})^{2}} a_{i}^{2} \leq \sum_{i=1}^{p} \frac{\Lambda_{i,i}}{(\Lambda_{i,i} + \lambda_{1})^{2}} a_{i}^{2}.$$
This last inequality is true because $\frac{\Lambda_{i,i}}{(\Lambda_{i,i} + \lambda_{2})^{2}} \leq \frac{\Lambda_{i,i}}{(\Lambda_{i,i} + \lambda_{1})^{2}}$ for each $i \in \{1,...,p\}$, which follows because $\Lambda_{i,i} \geq 0$. 
Taking $\lambda_{1} = 0$, we have $||w^*_l ||_2^2 \geq ||w^*_r ||_2^2$ as desired.
