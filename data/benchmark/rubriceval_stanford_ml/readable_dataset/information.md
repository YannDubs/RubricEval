Shannon's information theory has been a cornerstone in the development of modern communication systems. However, it is now used much more broadly in machine learning, statistics, and other fields. One issue with Shannon's theory is that it studies the existence of information rather than its quality or usability. Specifically, Shannonâ€™s information misses two key aspects of the downstream task. First, it is agnostic to how the actions or predictions from the decision maker (DM) will be evaluated. Second, it does not depend on the computational constraints of the DM, e.g., a polynomial-time complexity algorithm or a linear predictor. As a result, its applications in decision-making or machine learning can give rise to false claims. For example, the data processing inequality would imply that features of deeper layers in a neural network are less informative than earlier ones. Similarly, as mutual information is invariant to bijections, encrypting a message should not alter its informativeness for any DM, which is, of course, not true in practice.

A potential solution to this problem is to generalize Shannon's information theory by taking a utilitarian perspective that considers both the potential actions (i.e., its computational constraints) of the decision maker and the loss function that will be used to evaluate the actions. We call this utilitarian information theory. Here's an explanation of it.

## Background: Predictions, Bayes Risk, and Bayes Decision Theory with Computationally Bounded Agents

In standard Bayes decision theory, a decision maker (DM) wants to minimize some expected loss $\ell$ when given samples from an underlying distribution $\mathbb{P}(Y)$.
Specifically, the DM decides on an action $a \in \mathcal{A}$ and then incurs an expected loss $\operatorname{E}_{\mathbb{P}(Y)}[\ell(Y,a)]$. In many scenarios, the DM can choose the optimal action after seeing outcomes from a related random variable $X$. The DM then incurs the conditional expected loss $\operatorname{E}_{\mathbb{P}(X)}\left[\inf_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \operatorname{E}_{\mathbb{P}(Y \mid X)}[\ell(Y,a)]\right]$.
Real DMs, however, are often computationally bounded, which raises the question: what if finding the optimal action $a$ is computationally intractable? What if not every action can be taken for any outcome $X$? What if the DM is constrained to taking related actions? These questions about computationally bounded DMs are important in practice but are rarely discussed in Bayes decision theory. 
To answer these questions, it is useful to take a predictive perspective, whereby the DM has to choose a predictor $f$ from inputs $X$ to actions in $\mathcal{A}$.
The conditional expected loss can then be equivalently rewritten as $\inf_{f \in \mathcal{U}} \operatorname{E}_{\mathbb{P}(Y,X)}[\ell(Y,f(X))]$, where the infimum is over all possible predictors $\mathcal{U}=\mathcal{A}^\mathcal{X}$. The previous questions then simply amount to asking what if the DM is restricted to selecting from a subset of predictors $\mathcal{V} \subseteq \mathcal{U}$ that are usually "simple".
The resulting loss incurred by the bounded DM then simply corresponds to the Bayes risk for predictive family (also called hypothesis class) $\mathcal{V}$ and loss $\ell$, i.e., $\inf_{f \in \mathcal{V}} \operatorname{E}_{\mathbb{P}(Y,X)}[\ell(Y,f(X))]$, which is well studied in statistical learning theory.
The predictors that achieve the Bayes risk are then called Bayes predictors $\mathcal{V}_{p,\ell}^*$.
Our framework of Utilitarian Information Theory is the study of how useful some information is for this restricted DM whose actions are evaluated by general $\ell$.

## Utilitarian Information Theory

The intuition behind Shannon's conditional entropy is to measure how much uncertainty one has about some random variable $Y$ if one knows about another random variable $X$, i.e., $\operatorname{H}(Y \mid X) \defeq \inf_{f \in \mathcal{U}} \operatorname{E}_{\mathbb{P}(Y,X)}[\ell(Y,q(X))] = \inf_{f \in \mathcal{U}} \operatorname{E}_{\mathbb{P}(Y,X)}[\ell(Y,q(X))]$.
From the perspective of our restricted DM, it is then very natural to measure such uncertainty by the minimal loss that she would incur when predicting $Y$ given $X$, i.e., the Bayes risk. 
Our \textit{utilitarian conditional entropy} is then naturally defined as $\operatorname{H}_{\ell,\mathcal{V}}(Y \mid X) \defeq \inf_{f \in \mathcal{V}} \operatorname{E}_{\mathbb{P}(Y,X)}[\ell(Y,f(X))]$.

Similarly, Shannon's (marginal) entropy $\operatorname{H}(Y)$ measures how much uncertainty one has about a random variable $Y$ prior to seeing any other information.
Our \textit{utilitarian (marginal) entropy} is then naturally defined by the uncertainty the DM has about $Y$ without additional knowledge, i.e., the unconditional Bayes risk $\operatorname{H}_{\ell}(Y) \defeq \inf_{a \in \mathcal{A}}\operatorname{E}_{\mathbb{P}(Y)}[\ell(Y,a)]$. Note that the DM's boundedness only enters decision theory when she has access to additional knowledge $X$, so our marginal entropy does not depend on $\mathcal{V}$.

The intuition behind Shannon's mutual information is to measure how much the knowledge of a random variable $X$ decreases your uncertainty about another $Y$, i.e., $\operatorname{I}(Y;X) = \operatorname{H}(Y) - \operatorname{H}(Y \mid X)$.
The same construction naturally gives rise to a notion of \textit{utilitarian information} $\operatorname{I}_{\ell,\mathcal{V}}(X;Y) = \operatorname{H}_{\ell}(Y) - \operatorname{H}_{\ell,\mathcal{V}}(Y \mid X)$, which measures the decrease in uncertainty for the constrained DM evaluated by $\ell$, i.e., how much better the DM can predict $Y$ if she has access to $X$.

Formally:

\begin{definition} [Action Predictive Family] Let $\Omega_{\text{action}} = \lbrace f: \mathcal{X} \cup \lbrace \emptyset \rbrace \to \mathcal{A} \rbrace$, we say that $\mathcal{V} \subset \Omega_{\text{action}}$ is a predictive family (for $\mathcal{A}$) if it satisfies 
\begin{align} 
\forall f \in \mathcal{V}, \forall a \in \mathrm{range}(f), \exists f' \in \mathcal{V}, \forall x\in\mathcal{X}, f'(x) = a, f'(\emptyset) = a 
\end{align} 
\end{definition}

Predictive families essentially mean that there always exists a function that can predict any constant value for any input. This is a very mild assumption that is satisfied by most hypothesis classes in practice. We also call this property Optional Ignorance.

\begin{definition} [Utilitarian Entropy] For any loss function $\ell$ and predictive family $\mathcal{V}$, the utilitarian entropy of a random variable $Y$ (potentially conditioned on another random variable $X$) is defined as
\begin{align}
    H_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(Y) &:= \inf_{f \in \mathcal{V}} \mathbb{E}\left[ \ell(Y, f[\emptyset]) \right] \\
    H_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(Y|X) &:= \inf_{f \in \mathcal{V}} \mathbb{E}\left[ \ell(Y, f[X]) \right]
\end{align} 
\end{definition} 
Intuitively, the Utilitarian Entropy is the Bayes risk, i.e., the risk of the best prediction function.

\begin{definition}[Utilitarian Mutual Information] For any loss function $\ell$, predictive family $\mathcal{V}$, and random variables $X$ and $Y$, the utilitarian mutual information is defined as 
\begin{align} 
I_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(X \to Y) := H_{\ell, \mathcal{V}} (Y) - H_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(Y \mid X)
\end{align} 
\end{definition} 



## Questions

For each of the following statements, prove whether they are true or false. The proof whould be detailed.

1. Utilitarian information is always symmetric, i.e., $\operatorname{I}_{\ell,\mathcal{V}}(X; Y) = \operatorname{I}_{\ell,\mathcal{V}}(Y; X)$.
2. Utilitarian information is always non-negative.
3. Utilitarian information recovers Shannon's information theory for some choices of $\mathcal{V}$ and $\ell$.
4. Utilitarian information satisfies the Data Processing Inequality, i.e., the Markov Chain $Z \to X \to Y$ implies $\operatorname{I}_{\ell,\mathcal{V}}(X; Y) \leq \operatorname{I}_{\ell,\mathcal{V}}(Z; Y)$.
5. Utilitarian information between two random variables $X$ and $Y$ that are independent is always zero.
6. Utilitarian information is always invariant to bijections, i.e., $\operatorname{I}_{\ell,\mathcal{V}}(X; Y) = \operatorname{I}_{\ell,\mathcal{V}}(b_X(X); Y)$ for any bijection $b_X$.

For each of those questions also provide an explanation / illustration of why that makes sense for machine learning. 


# <expert_solution>:


## Symmetry

**False.** Utilitarian information is not symmetric.

*Counterexample:*  
Consider random variables \(X\) taking values in \(\{0,1,2\}\) and \(Y\) taking values in \(\{0,2\}\). Assume the following conditional probabilities:  
- \(\mathbb{P}(Y = 0 \mid X = 0) = 1\)  
- \(\mathbb{P}(Y = 2 \mid X = 1) = 1\)  
- \(\mathbb{P}(Y = 2 \mid X = 2) = 1\)  
And the marginal probabilities:  
- \(\mathbb{P}(X = 0) = 0.5\)  
- \(\mathbb{P}(X = 1) = 0.25\)  
- \(\mathbb{P}(X = 2) = 0.25\)  

Consider the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the loss function \(\ell\) and the predictive family \(\mathcal{V}\) consisting of the following functions:  
- \(c_0(\emptyset) = 0\), \(c_1(\emptyset) = 1\), \(c_2(\emptyset) = 2\)  
- \(f(X = 0) = 0, f(X = 1) = 2, f(X = 2) = 2\)  
- \(g(\cdot) = 1\)  

The conditional entropy \(\operatorname{H}_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(Y \mid X) = 0\) because the optimal predictor \(f\) can perfectly predict \(Y\) given \(X\). However, \(\operatorname{H}_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(X \mid Y) = 0.25\) since \(f\) cannot predict \(X = 1\) when conditioned on \(Y = 2\). The marginal entropies are:  
- \(\operatorname{H}_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(Y) = 1\)  
- \(\operatorname{H}_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(X) = 0.75\)  

Therefore, the utilitarian mutual information is:  
\[
\operatorname{I}_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(X; Y) = 1 - 0 = 1, \quad \text{but} \quad \operatorname{I}_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(Y; X) = 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5.
\]
Since \(\operatorname{I}_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(X; Y) \neq \operatorname{I}_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(Y; X)\), utilitarian information is not symmetric.

*Machine Learning Perspective:* In practical machine learning, predicting a target variable from features is often easier than the reverse. For example, in classification tasks, predicting the class label (a lower-dimensional output) from features (often high-dimensional and complex) is generally more straightforward than predicting the features given the class label.

## Non-Negativity

**True.** Utilitarian information is always non-negative.

*Proof:*  
By definition, a predictive family \(\mathcal{V}\) is constructed to include constant predictors such that for every action \(a \in \mathcal{A}\), there exists a constant predictor \(f_a \in \mathcal{V}\) satisfying:
\[
f_a(X) = a, \quad \forall X.
\]
This implies:
\[
\operatorname{H}_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(Y \mid X) = \inf_{f \in \mathcal{V}} \operatorname{E}_{\mathbb{P}(Y, X)}[\ell(Y, f(X))] \leq \inf_{a \in \mathcal{A}} \operatorname{E}_{\mathbb{P}(Y)}[\ell(Y, a)] = \operatorname{H}_{\ell}(Y).
\]
Thus:
\[
\operatorname{I}_{\ell,\mathcal{V}}(X; Y) = \operatorname{H}_{\ell}(Y) - \operatorname{H}_{\ell,\mathcal{V}}(Y \mid X) \geq 0.
\]

*Machine Learning Perspective:* In machine learning, having access to additional features or information can never worsen a model's performance since it always has the option not to use that information. Thus, additional information can only help or maintain the current state, ensuring non-negativity.

## Recovery of Shannon's Information Theory

**True.** Utilitarian information can recover Shannon's information theory for specific choices of \(\mathcal{V}\) and \(\ell\).

*Proof:*  
Consider the logarithmic loss (cross-entropy loss), which is common in information theory and machine learning. For a predicted probability distribution \(q(Y)\) and the true distribution \(p(Y)\), the logarithmic loss is:
\[
\ell(Y, q) = -\log q(Y).
\]
The expected logarithmic loss over a distribution \(\mathbb{P}(Y)\) is:
\[
\operatorname{E}_{\mathbb{P}(Y)}[\ell(Y, q)] = -\operatorname{E}_{\mathbb{P}(Y)}[\log q(Y)].
\]
The Bayes risk for this loss function is achieved when \(q = p\), the true conditional distribution of \(Y\) given \(X\). This Bayes risk corresponds to the conditional entropy:
\[
\operatorname{H}(Y \mid X) = -\operatorname{E}_{\mathbb{P}(Y, X)}[\log \mathbb{P}(Y \mid X)].
\]

*Choice of Predictive Family \(\mathcal{V}\):*  
Let \(\mathcal{V}\) be the set of all possible conditional distributions \(q(Y \mid X)\), i.e., the set of all functions \(f: \mathcal{X} \to \Delta_{\mathcal{Y}}\) where \(\Delta_{\mathcal{Y}}\) is the set of all probability distributions over \(\mathcal{Y}\). This choice of \(\mathcal{V}\) includes all probabilistic mappings from \(X\) to \(Y\), and is effectively unrestricted.

Utilitarian mutual information with logarithmic loss and predictive family \(\mathcal{V}\) is:
\[
\operatorname{I}_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(X; Y) = \operatorname{H}_{\ell}(Y) - \operatorname{H}_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(Y \mid X).
\]
Given the logarithmic loss as a proper scoring rule, the infimum of expected loss is attained when the predicted distribution matches the true distribution. Thus:
\[
\operatorname{I}_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(X; Y) = \operatorname{H}(Y) - \operatorname{H}(Y \mid X) = \operatorname{I}(X; Y).
\]
Thus, by selecting appropriate \(\ell\) and \(\mathcal{V}\), utilitarian information theory recovers Shannon's information theory.

*Machine Learning Perspective:* When unconstrained (having full access to all features and complexity), utilitarian information theory aligns with Shannon's framework, retaining all its properties.

## Data Processing Inequality

**False.** Utilitarian information does not necessarily satisfy the Data Processing Inequality.

*Counterexample:*  
Consider random variables \(X\) taking values in \(\{0,2\}\) and \(Y\) taking values in \(\{0,1,2\}\). Assume:  
- \(\mathbb{P}(Y = 0 \mid X = 0) = 1\)  
- \(\mathbb{P}(Y = 2 \mid X = 2) = \mathbb{P}(Y = 1 \mid X = 2) = 0.5\)  
- \(\mathbb{P}(X = 0) = \mathbb{P}(X = 2) = 0.5\)  

Using MAE loss \(\ell\) and the predictive family \(\mathcal{V}\) consisting of functions:  
- \(c_0(\emptyset) = 0, c_1(\emptyset) = 1, c_2(\emptyset) = 2\)  
- \(f(X = 0) = 0, f(X = 1) = 1, f(X = 2) = 11\)  
- \(g(\cdot) = 2\)  

The utilitarian marginal and conditional entropies are both 1. Predicting with \(f\) yields a higher risk since it cannot predict well when \(X = 2\). The risk using \(f\) is \(0 + 10 \times 0.25 + 11 \times 0.25 = 5.25\). Predicting with \(c_0\) yields a risk of 0.75. Thus, \(\operatorname{I}_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(X; Y) = 0.75

 - 0.75 = 0\). However, if a function \(h\) exists such that \(h(2) = 1\) and is the identity otherwise, then \(f\) applied to \(h(X)\) becomes a good predictor, making \(\operatorname{I}_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(h(X); Y) = 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5\). Given \(X - h(X) - Y\) is a Markov chain, \(\operatorname{I}_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(h(X); Y) = 0.5 > 0 = \operatorname{I}_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(X; Y)\), violating the Data Processing Inequality.

*Machine Learning Perspective:* Feature preprocessing can enhance the "extractability" of information by a predictor, even if a preprocessing function is bijective. This reflects practical scenarios where feature engineering or transformations can increase predictive power.

## Independence

**True.** Utilitarian information between two independent random variables \(X\) and \(Y\) is always zero.

*Proof:*  
Using independence:
\[
\operatorname{H}_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(Y \mid X) = \inf_{f \in \mathcal{V}} \operatorname{E}_{(X, Y) \sim \mathbb{P}(X, Y)}[\ell(Y, f(X))] = \inf_{f \in \mathcal{V}} \operatorname{E}_{X \sim \mathbb{P}(X)} \operatorname{E}_{Y \sim \mathbb{P}(Y)}[\ell(Y, f(X))].
\]
By Jensen's inequality and the assumption of Optional Ignorance, we get:
\[
\operatorname{H}_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(Y \mid X) \geq \operatorname{E}_{X \sim \mathbb{P}(X)} \left[ \inf_{f \in \mathcal{V}} \operatorname{E}_{Y \sim \mathbb{P}(Y)}[\ell(Y, f(X))] \right] = \operatorname{H}_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(Y).
\]
Thus:
\[
\operatorname{I}_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(X; Y) = \operatorname{H}_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(Y) - \operatorname{H}_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(Y \mid X) \leq 0.
\]
Combining with non-negativity, we have \(\operatorname{I}_{\ell, \mathcal{V}}(X; Y) = 0\).

*Machine Learning Perspective:* When two variables are independent, they provide no information about each other. This is fundamental in machine learning, where independent features or labels do not inform predictions.

## Invariance to Bijections

**False.** Utilitarian information is not always invariant to bijections.

*Counterexample:*  
Consider the previous example where a function \(h\) was a bijection that improved mutual information. Applying a function can increase utilitarian information by enabling the constrained predictor to better predict the target variable. This makes sense for machine learning because preprocessing features can often enhance predictive accuracy, even if the transformation is bijective.

**Conclusion:** Utilitarian information theory provides a more nuanced approach to information theory in the context of machine learning by incorporating computational constraints and task-specific loss functions. This aligns well with practical scenarios where perfect information is unattainable, and decision-makers must operate within computational and informational limits.
