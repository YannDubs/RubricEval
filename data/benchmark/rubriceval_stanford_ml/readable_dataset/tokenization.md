Before passing text through a transformer, the text is often processed into tokens corresponding to common subwords. What is one clear/unarguable benefit of tokenizing subwords compared to tokenizing each character (or byte) separately?
# <expert_solution>:
Subword tokenization results in shorter sequences, so faster training/inference, especially given the O(n^2) cost of transformers. Using tokens may also improve data efficiency, but that's an arguable benefit.
# <expert_checklist>:
[
  "Does the response clearly identify that subword tokenization results in shorter sequences compared to character-level tokenization? (High importance)",
  "Is the explanation of how shorter sequences lead to faster training and inference due to the O(n^2) cost of transformers included? (High importance)",
  "Does the response avoid mentioning arguable benefits such as improved data efficiency, focusing only on clear/unarguable benefits? (Moderate importance)",
  "Is the concept of subword tokenization versus character tokenization explained in a way that is understandable to non-experts? (Moderate importance)",
  "Does the response provide a concise and clear explanation without unnecessary jargon or complexity? (Low importance)",
  "Is the response free from errors or misconceptions about tokenization and its impact on transformer models? (High importance)",
  "Does the response stay focused on the main question without diverging into unrelated topics? (Moderate importance)"
