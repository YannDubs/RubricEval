Before passing text through a transformer, the text is often processed into tokens corresponding to common subwords. What is one clear/unarguable benefit of tokenizing subwords compared to tokenizing each character (or byte) separately?
# <expert_solution>:
Subword tokenization results in shorter sequences, so faster training/inference, especially given the O(n^2) cost of transformers. Using tokens may also improve data efficiency, but that's not an arguable benefit.
# <expert_checklist>:
[
  "Is the benefit of subword tokenization over character or byte tokenization clearly unarguable?",
  "Does the respond recorgnize that using tokens results in shorter sequences to the transformer?",
  "Does the respond recognize that shorter sequences means faster training/inference, especially given the O(n^2) cost of transformers?",
  "Is the reasoning behind the benefit logically sound? Note that it could be something else than speed if the answer is correct and unarguable.",
  "Is the answer concise and avoid irrelevant/unnecessary details?",
  "Is the answer clear and easy to understand?"
