Consider a simple grid world environment. The environment is a 3x3 grid, where each cell represents a state $s \in \{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_9\}$, going top-to-bottom and left-to-right.
The top-left corner of the grid is $s_1$, and the bottom-right is $s_9$.
The top-middle is $s_2$, the top-right is $s_3$, etc.

The agent can perform four possible actions in each state: up, down, left, and right. Actions that would move the agent off the grid have no effect (the agent stays in the same state).

The agent starts in the top-left corner of the grid ($s_1$) and aims to reach the bottom-right corner ($s_9$). The reward function $R(s, a)$ is defined as follows:

```latex
\begin{itemize}
    \item $R(s, a) = 1$ if $s = s_9$
    \item $R(s, a) = -0.1$ for all other states $s \neq s_9$
\end{itemize}
```

Assume the agent follows an optimal policy and the discount factor is $\gamma = 0.9$. assume we initialize $V(s_i) = 0$ for all states

 After performing one full update step of value iteration across all states, determine the optimal action $a^*(s)$ for the agent in state $s_5$ (the center of the grid). What is the expected reward of taking this action?
# <expert_solution>:
The environment is deterministic, so our value iteration update rule is:
$$ V'(s) = \max_a  R(s, a) + \gamma V(s') $$

Which gives us:
```latex
\begin{align*}
    V'(s_2) &= \max(-0.1 + 0.9 \cdot 0, -0.1 + 0.9 \cdot 0, -0.1 + 0.9 \cdot 0) = -0.1\\
    V'(s_4) &= \max(-0.1 + 0.9 \cdot 0, -0.1 + 0.9 \cdot 0, -0.1 + 0.9 \cdot 0) = -0.1\\
    V'(s_6) &= \max(-0.1 + 0.9 \cdot 0, -0.1 + 0.9 \cdot 0, 1 + 0.9 \cdot 0) = 1\\
    V'(s_8) &= \max(-0.1 + 0.9 \cdot 0, -0.1 + 0.9 \cdot 0, 1 + 0.9 \cdot 0) = 1
\end{align*}
```
Here we are only considering the values of states that are reachable from the state $s_5$.

Possible actions from $s_5$:
```latex
\begin{itemize}
    \item Up (to $s_2$): $R(s_5, \text{up}) + \gamma V'(s_2) = -0.1 + 0.9 \cdot -0.1 = -0.19$
    \item Left (to $s_4$): $R(s_5, \text{left}) + \gamma V'(s_4) = -0.1 + 0.9 \cdot -0.1 = -0.19$
    \item Right (to $s_6$): $R(s_5, \text{right}) + \gamma V'(s_6) = -0.1 + 0.9 \cdot 1 = 0.8$
    \item Down (to $s_8$): $R(s_5, \text{down}) + \gamma V'(s_8) = -0.1 + 0.9 \cdot 1 = 0.8$
\end{itemize}
```

The optimal action \( a^*(s_5) \) is "down" or "right" with the value of 0.8.
