        "clear_goals":"The learning objectives of the assignment are for the LLM to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of project-based learning, specifically in the context of the working of a remote using infrared rays. The LLM should be able to explain the concept of project-based learning, detail the mechanism by which remote controls use infrared rays, guide the reader through a project that demonstrates this mechanism, and encourage critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Additionally, the LLM should provide practical information such as a list of materials needed, safety precautions, troubleshooting tips, and further resources for exploration.",
        "reference_answer":"Project-based learning is an educational approach that involves students in complex, real-world projects to help them learn and apply knowledge and skills. In the context of understanding the working of a remote using infrared rays, a project could involve designing and building a simple remote control device. This project would require students to explore how infrared rays can be used to transmit signals from a remote to a receiver, such as a television. Students would learn about the components of a remote control, including the infrared LED, and how it emits light that is invisible to the human eye but can be detected by the receiver. The project would involve assembling the necessary electronic components, programming the remote to send specific signals, and testing its functionality. Safety precautions, such as handling electronic components safely and avoiding direct exposure to infrared light, would be emphasized. The project would encourage students to engage in problem-solving, such as troubleshooting issues with signal transmission or component malfunction. Further reading resources could include articles on the physics of light, the history of remote control technology, and advances in infrared communication.",
        "critique":"The reference answer provides a broad overview but lacks specific details that would be necessary for a comprehensive report. For example, it does not provide a step-by-step guide for the project, a detailed list of materials needed, or specific troubleshooting tips. Additionally, while it mentions safety precautions and further reading resources, it does not offer concrete examples or references. Potential pitfalls for an LLM when addressing this prompt include oversimplifying the technical aspects of how infrared rays work in remote controls, failing to provide a clear and detailed project plan, and not adequately addressing the educational objectives of project-based learning.",

Haptic feedback mechanisms can be used to provide tactile sensations, mimicking the feel of sword combat. To ensure player comfort and prevent motion sickness, the system should include options for adjusting movement sensitivity and provide clear visual cues. Balancing the combat system to be challenging yet fair is crucial, as is incorporating high-quality sound design to reinforce the realism of sword clashes and movements. Utilizing motion capture or similar technologies can help create lifelike sword fighting animations.
