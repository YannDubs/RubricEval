        "clear_goals":"The learning objectives of the assignment are for the LLM to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of project-based learning, specifically in the context of the working of a remote using infrared rays. The LLM should be able to explain the concept of project-based learning, detail the mechanism by which remote controls use infrared rays, guide the reader through a project that demonstrates this mechanism, and encourage critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Additionally, the LLM should provide practical information such as a list of materials needed, safety precautions, troubleshooting tips, and further resources for exploration.",
        "reference_answer":"Project-based learning is an educational approach that involves students in complex, real-world projects to help them learn and apply knowledge and skills. In the context of understanding the working of a remote using infrared rays, a project could involve designing and building a simple remote control device. This project would require students to explore how infrared rays can be used to transmit signals from a remote to a receiver, such as a television. Students would learn about the components of a remote control, including the infrared LED, and how it emits light that is invisible to the human eye but can be detected by the receiver. The project would involve assembling the necessary electronic components, programming the remote to send specific signals, and testing its functionality. Safety precautions, such as handling electronic components safely and avoiding direct exposure to infrared light, would be emphasized. The project would encourage students to engage in problem-solving, such as troubleshooting issues with signal transmission or component malfunction. Further reading resources could include articles on the physics of light, the history of remote control technology, and advances in infrared communication.",

For example, it does not provide a step-by-step guide for the project, a detailed list of materials needed, or specific troubleshooting tips. Additionally, while it mentions safety precautions and further reading resources, it does not offer concrete examples or references. Potential pitfalls for an LLM when addressing this prompt include oversimplifying the technical aspects of how infrared rays work in remote controls, failing to provide a clear and detailed project plan, and not adequately addressing the educational objectives of project-based learning.",

        "output":"Creating a realistic swordsman combat system for VR involves blending precise motion tracking, responsive AI, and immersive feedback mechanisms. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:\n\n### 1. **Hardware and Setup**\n- **VR Headset and Controllers:** Use high-fidelity VR headsets (like Oculus Quest, HTC Vive, or Valve Index) with motion controllers.\n- **Tracking:** Ensure your setup supports accurate motion tracking. Consider additional trackers for full-body motion capture if required.\n\n### 2. **Player Movement and Interaction**\n- **Sword Handling:** Implement physics-based handling for swords. The sword should respond to the user\u2019s hand movements in real-time.\n- **Collision Detection:** Utilize robust collision detection algorithms to register when swords clash or when a sword hits an enemy.\n- **Haptic Feedback:** Provide haptic feedback through the controllers when swords collide or when the player\u2019s sword makes contact with an enemy.\n\n### 3. **AI Opponent Behavior**\n- **Blocking and Parrying:** Develop AI that can respond to the player\u2019s actions. If the player blocks an attack, the AI should recognize it and transition to the next move.\n- **Attack Patterns:** Implement a variety of attack patterns such as slashes, thrusts, and feints. Ensure the AI can switch tactics based on the player\u2019s movements.\n- **Response Time:** Fine-tune the AI\u2019s response time to make the combat feel realistic and challenging without being unfair.\n\n### 4. **Combat Mechanics**\n- **Blocking:** Design a blocking system where the angle and timing of the block matter. The player should have to position their sword correctly to block effectively.\n- **Counter-attacks:** Enable the AI to perform counter-attacks after a block is detected. For example, after a block, the AI could immediately go for a thrust.\n- **Stamina and Cooldowns:** Introduce a stamina system to prevent constant blocking and attacking, adding a layer of strategy.\n\n### 5. **Animation and Physics**\n- **Inverse Kinematics (IK):** Use IK to make the AI\u2019s movements more fluid and realistic. This helps in making the AI\u2019s follow-up attacks (like thrusts) look natural.\n- **Ragdoll Physics:** Implement ragdoll physics for realistic reactions to hits and blocks. This can enhance immersion when the player successfully blocks or strikes.\n\n### 6. **Sound and Visual Effects**\n- **Sound Effects:** Use directional sound effects for sword clashes, enemy grunts, and footsteps to enhance immersion.\n- **Visual Cues:** Implement visual effects like sparks when swords clash or a slight glow to indicate a successful block.\n\n### 7. **Playtesting and Iteration**\n- **User Feedback:** Conduct playtesting sessions to gather feedback on the responsiveness and realism of the combat system.\n- **Tuning:** Continuously refine the AI behavior, physics, and feedback mechanisms based on player feedback and testing results.\n\n### Example Implementation Steps\n1. **Sword Handling:**\n   ```cpp\n   \/\/ Pseudocode for handling sword movement\n   SwordPosition = VRControllerPosition;\n   SwordRotation = VRControllerRotation;\n   ```\n\n2. **Collision Detection:**\n   ```cpp\n   \/\/ Pseudocode for collision detection\n   if (Sword1.CollidesWith(Sword2)) {\n       ProvideHapticFeedback();\n       PlaySound(\"clash\");\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **AI Behavior:**\n   ```cpp\n   \/\/ Pseudocode for AI decision making\n   if (Player.Blocks(attack)) {\n       AI.PerformCounterAttack(\"thrust\");\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Blocking Mechanism:**\n   ```cpp\n   \/\/ Pseudocode for blocking\n   if (PlayerSword.Position == CorrectBlockPosition && timingIsCorrect) {\n       BlockSuccess();\n   } else {\n       PlayerTakesDamage();\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. **Animation and Physics:**\n   ```cpp\n   \/\/ Pseudocode for IK and ragdoll physics\n   AIArm.IKTarget = PlayerSwordPosition;\n   if (AI.TakesHit()) {\n       AI.Ragdoll();\n   }\n   ```\n\nBy combining these elements, you can create an engaging and realistic swordsman combat system for VR that reacts dynamically to player actions and provides a satisfying, immersive experience.",
