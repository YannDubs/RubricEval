The subjectivity of first-person narration (in the form of a diary at the end) is combined with the objectivity of third-person narration, resulting in a narrative voice that is capable of conveying Stephen\u2019s experiences and thoughts with an immediacy and an intimacy that, until then, had been rarely achieved in the bildungsroman form. Indeed, the book focuses so closely on Stephen, and takes us so deeply into his mind, that at times it resembles a first-person narrative. By doing so, the inner life of Stephen seeks to delineate in such a way that it does not merely serve the unfolding of the story but becomes the story. The narrator presents Stephen\u2019s consciousness and activities in various ways; an important aspect about his narration is that he persistently adapts his style to Stephen\u2019s idiom and mood\n",
