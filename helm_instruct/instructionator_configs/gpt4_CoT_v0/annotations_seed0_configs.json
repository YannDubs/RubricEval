This can be assessed through tasks such as analyzing the emotion of the writer, generating empathetic responses, understanding the emotional state of a character, etc.\n - Multi-language Proficiency: Evaluate how well the model performs across different languages, not just in terms of fluency, but also in understanding cultural nuances, idioms, and colloquialisms. This can be assessed through tasks such as translation, understanding of cultural references, idiomatic expressions, etc.\n - Robustness: Test the model's ability to understand and respond appropriately even in the presence of noise(e.g. typos, grammatical errors, ...), conflicting pieces of information, ambiguity, missing or irrelevant information, and other adversarial inputs.\n - Argumentation: This involves the capacity to construct and evaluate arguments, often based on evidence and reasoning. This can be assessed through tasks such as writing persuasive essays, debating, evaluating the strength of an argument, etc.\n - Analyzing & Interpreting Data: This involves the capacity to understand, analyze, and interpret data, often using statistical methods and tools.
