    "raw_completion":"\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\" This is the opening line of the novel \"A Tale of Two Cities\" by Charles Dickens. It is a paradoxical statement that refers to the contrasting conditions of the two cities, London and Paris, during the French Revolution. The sentence means that there were both good and bad times during that period of history."
